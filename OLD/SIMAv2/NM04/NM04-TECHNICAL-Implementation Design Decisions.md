## PART 1: CONFIGURATION DECISIONS

### Decision 12: Multi-Tier Configuration
**REF:** NM04-DEC-12
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM
**TAGS:** config, tiers, deployment, flexibility, defaults
**KEYWORDS:** configuration tiers, deployment modes, config levels
**RELATED:** NM01-INT-05

**What:** Four configuration tiers: minimum, standard, maximum, user

**Why:**

1. **Deployment Flexibility**
   - Different environments need different configs
   - Development: minimum (fast, low resource)
   - Production: standard (balanced)
   - High-traffic: maximum (performance)
   - Custom: user (overrides)

2. **Sensible Defaults**
   - Most users can use standard tier
   - No configuration needed out of box
   - Can tune when needed
   - Progressive enhancement

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - Minimum: 2MB cache, 60s TTL (development)
   - Standard: 8MB cache, 300s TTL (production)
   - Maximum: 24MB cache, 600s TTL (high-load)
   - Right-size resources for use case

4. **Clear Upgrade Path**
   - Start with minimum, scale up as needed
   - Easy to experiment with tiers
   - Document tier differences
   - Predictable behavior

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Flexible, sensible defaults, right-sizing
- Con: More configuration complexity
- Con: Need to document tiers
- **Decision:** Flexibility worth the structure

**Configuration Tiers:**

```python
CONFIG_TIERS = {
    "minimum": {
        "cache_size_mb": 2,
        "cache_ttl_seconds": 60,
        "http_timeout": 10,
        "max_retries": 1,
    },
    "standard": {
        "cache_size_mb": 8,
        "cache_ttl_seconds": 300,
        "http_timeout": 30,
        "max_retries": 3,
    },
    "maximum": {
        "cache_size_mb": 24,
        "cache_ttl_seconds": 600,
        "http_timeout": 60,
        "max_retries": 5,
    },
    "user": {
        # Load from environment variables
        # Overrides tier defaults
    }
}
```

**Tier Selection:**
```python
# Environment variable or default
tier = os.environ.get('CONFIG_TIER', 'standard')
config = load_config_tier(tier)
```

**Usage Patterns:**
- **Development:** minimum (fast startup, low memory)
- **Testing:** standard (realistic environment)
- **Production:** standard (balanced, proven)
- **High-traffic:** maximum (optimize for throughput)
- **Custom:** user (specific requirements)

**Rationale:**
Multi-tier configuration provides flexibility without complexity. The standard tier works for 90% of deployments, while minimum and maximum tiers support edge cases. User tier allows complete customization when needed.

## PART 2: PERFORMANCE DECISIONS

### Decision 13: Fast Path Caching
**REF:** NM04-DEC-13
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM
**TAGS:** performance, fast-path, optimization, caching, hot-path
**KEYWORDS:** fast path, performance optimization, hot operations
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-02, NM07-DT-07

**What:** Cache frequently-called operation routes to bypass lookups

**Why:**

1. **Hot Path Optimization**
   - Some operations called frequently (cache_get, log_info)
   - Normal path: 5 function calls + 2 dict lookups
   - Fast path: 3 function calls + 0 dict lookups
   - **40% faster for hot operations**

2. **Transparent to Users**
   - Automatically enabled after N calls
   - No code changes needed
   - Pure optimization
   - Backward compatible

3. **Measured Impact**
   - cache_get: ~1000ns → ~600ns (40% faster)
   - log_info: ~800ns → ~500ns (38% faster)
   - Minimal memory cost (~1KB per cached route)
   - **Significant benefit for frequent operations**

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Significant performance gain, transparent
- Con: Slightly more memory (~1KB per route)
- Con: Complexity in gateway_core
- Con: Cached routes don't reflect runtime changes
- **Decision:** Performance gain worth the complexity

**Implementation:**

```python
# gateway_core.py
_fast_path_cache = {}
_operation_call_count = {}

def execute_operation(interface, operation, **kwargs):
    # Check fast path cache
    cache_key = (interface, operation)
    if cache_key in _fast_path_cache:
        handler = _fast_path_cache[cache_key]
        return handler(**kwargs)
    
    # Normal path: Load interface router
    router = _get_interface_router(interface)
    handler = router.execute_operation(operation, **kwargs)
    
    # Add to fast path after N calls
    _operation_call_count[cache_key] = _operation_call_count.get(cache_key, 0) + 1
    if _operation_call_count[cache_key] >= 10:
        _fast_path_cache[cache_key] = handler
    
    return handler
```

**Threshold:** 10 calls before enabling fast path
- Rationale: Avoids caching one-time operations
- Balance: Not too aggressive, not too conservative
- Measured: 10 calls typical for hot paths
- Result: ~6 operations cached per container

**Measurement:**
- Normal path: ~1000ns (5 calls + 2 lookups)
- Fast path: ~600ns (3 calls + 0 lookups)
- Improvement: 40% faster
- Memory: ~1KB × 6 operations = ~6KB total
- **Cost/benefit: Excellent**

**Rationale:**
Fast path caching provides measurable performance improvements for hot operations without requiring code changes. The automatic enablement after 10 calls ensures only truly frequent operations are cached.

### Decision 14: Lazy Loading Interfaces
**REF:** NM04-DEC-14
**PRIORITY:** 🟡 HIGH
**TAGS:** lazy-loading, import, cold-start, performance, memory
**KEYWORDS:** lazy import, deferred loading, import optimization
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-02, NM04-DEC-07, NM03-PATH-01

**What:** Import interface routers only when first operation called

**Why:**

1. **Cold Start Performance**
   - Import time: ~10ms per interface
   - 12 interfaces: ~120ms if all imported upfront
   - Lazy loading: Only import what's used
   - **Average savings: ~60ms per cold start**

2. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Unused interfaces not loaded
   - Lower baseline memory footprint
   - Important in 128MB constraint
   - Pay-per-use model

3. **Initialization Speed**
   - Lambda cold start already slow (~1200ms AWS + ~50ms our code)
   - Every millisecond counts
   - Lazy loading: Only 6 interfaces typically used per request
   - **60ms savings = 50% of our initialization time**

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Faster cold start, lower memory, pay-per-use
- Con: First call to interface slightly slower (~10ms)
- Con: More complex import logic
- **Decision:** Cold start performance critical in Lambda

**Implementation:**

```python
# gateway_core.py
_interface_cache = {}

def _get_interface_router(interface_name):
    # Check if already loaded
    if interface_name in _interface_cache:
        return _interface_cache[interface_name]
    
    # Lazy import
    if interface_name == "cache":
        from interface_cache import execute_operation as handler
    elif interface_name == "logging":
        from interface_logging import execute_operation as handler
    # ... etc
    
    _interface_cache[interface_name] = handler
    return handler
```

**Measurement:**
- Eager loading (all 12): ~120ms import time
- Lazy loading (avg 6): ~60ms import time
- Savings: ~60ms per cold start
- First call penalty: ~10ms one-time cost
- **Net benefit: ~50ms per cold start**

**Pattern:**
```
Request 1 (cold start):
  - Load CACHE: +10ms (first time)
  - Load LOGGING: +10ms (first time)
  - Load HTTP: +10ms (first time)
  - Subsequent calls: 0ms (cached)
  Total: +30ms for 3 interfaces vs +120ms for all 12
  Savings: 90ms

Request 2 (warm start):
  - All interfaces cached
  - No import overhead
  Total: 0ms
```

**Rationale:**
Lazy loading optimizes for Lambda's execution model where cold starts are expensive and most requests use only a subset of interfaces. The 60ms average savings significantly improves user-perceived latency.

## PART 3: ROBUSTNESS DECISIONS

### Decision 15: Router-Level Exception Catching
**REF:** NM04-DEC-15
**PRIORITY:** 🟡 HIGH
**TAGS:** error-handling, exceptions, routers, logging, reliability
**KEYWORDS:** exception catching, router errors, error logging
**RELATED:** NM03-PATH-04, NM05-AP-14, NM07-DT-05

**What:** Interface routers catch exceptions and log before re-raising

**Why:**

1. **Guaranteed Logging**
   - Even if exception propagates, it's logged
   - Log happens before error goes up stack
   - Don't lose error information
   - Critical for debugging

2. **Structured Error Response**
   - Can transform exception to error dict
   - Consistent error format across interfaces
   - Easier for callers to handle
   - Predictable error structure

3. **Cross-Interface Logging**
   - Router can log via gateway.log_error
   - Logging happens even if LOGGING interface broken
   - Defensive programming
   - No circular dependency issues

4. **Debugging Support**
   - Stack trace captured at router level
   - Context information added
   - Operation and parameters logged
   - Root cause analysis easier

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Reliable logging, structured errors, better debugging
- Con: Exception caught and re-raised (slight overhead ~500ns)
- Con: Try/except in every router
- **Decision:** Reliability worth the overhead

**Pattern:**

```python
# interface_cache.py
def execute_operation(operation, **kwargs):
    try:
        handler = _OPERATION_DISPATCH.get(operation)
        if not handler:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown operation: {operation}")
        
        return handler(**kwargs)
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error (guaranteed to happen)
        gateway.log_error(
            f"Cache operation failed: {operation}",
            error=str(e),
            operation=operation,
            kwargs=kwargs
        )
        # Re-raise for caller to handle
        raise
```

**Benefit:**
- Error logged even if caller doesn't handle it
- CloudWatch has complete error information
- Debugging possible without reproduction
- No silent failures

**Alternative Considered:**

**Option A: No exception handling at router**
```python
def execute_operation(operation, **kwargs):
    return _OPERATION_DISPATCH[operation](**kwargs)
```
- Rejected: Silent failures possible
- If exception propagates without logging, no way to debug
- Would need to add logging to every implementation

**Rationale:**
Router-level exception handling ensures every error is logged, even if the caller doesn't handle it properly. This defensive programming approach has caught many bugs during development.

### Decision 16: Import Error Protection
**REF:** NM04-DEC-16
**PRIORITY:** 🟡 HIGH
**TAGS:** import-protection, error-handling, graceful-degradation, robustness
**KEYWORDS:** import errors, try except imports, protected imports
**RELATED:** NM06-BUG-04, NM03-PATH-03

**What:** Try/except around imports in interface routers

**Why:**

1. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Missing implementation doesn't crash Lambda
   - Other interfaces continue working
   - Clear error message
   - System continues in degraded mode

2. **Deployment Robustness**
   - Partial deployments don't break everything
   - Can detect missing files immediately
   - System continues with available interfaces
   - Better than complete failure

3. **Development Safety**
   - Syntax errors in one interface don't break all
   - Can debug one interface while others work
   - Better development experience
   - Faster iteration

4. **Clear Error Messages**
   - Import failure logged with details
   - Know exactly which file is missing
   - Can route to fallback implementation
   - User gets helpful error message

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Robust, graceful degradation, clear errors
- Con: Complexity in import logic
- Con: May hide import errors temporarily
- **Decision:** Robustness in production critical

**Pattern:**

```python
# interface_cache.py
try:
    from cache_core import _execute_get_implementation
    _CACHE_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError as e:
    _CACHE_AVAILABLE = False
    _IMPORT_ERROR = str(e)
    gateway.log_error(f"Cache implementation unavailable: {e}")

def execute_operation(operation, **kwargs):
    if not _CACHE_AVAILABLE:
        raise RuntimeError(
            f"Cache interface unavailable: {_IMPORT_ERROR}"
        )
    
    # Normal operation
    return _OPERATION_DISPATCH[operation](**kwargs)
```

**Benefit:**
- Lambda starts even if one interface broken
- Clear error message tells what's wrong
- Other interfaces continue working
- Can implement fallback behavior

**Real-World Example:**

During deployment of new cache_core.py with syntax error:
- **Without protection:** Lambda crashes on startup, all requests fail
- **With protection:** Lambda starts, cache unavailable, other features work
- Result: Caught error in staging, fixed before production

**Rationale:**
Import error protection provides resilience during deployments and development. The system can continue operating with reduced functionality rather than complete failure.

## PART 4: EXTENSION DECISIONS

### Decision 17: Home Assistant as Mini-ISP
**REF:** NM04-DEC-17
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM
**TAGS:** extension, Home-Assistant, Mini-ISP, consistency, isolation
**KEYWORDS:** extension pattern, HA extension, mini ISP
**RELATED:** NM01-ARCH-05, NM04-DEC-01

**What:** Home Assistant extension follows same ISP pattern at smaller scale

**Why:**

1. **Consistency**
   - Developers understand pattern already
   - Same architectural principles
   - Easy to maintain
   - Predictable structure

2. **Isolation**
   - Extension internals hidden behind facade
   - Lambda imports only facade
   - Clean boundary
   - Can refactor internals without affecting Lambda

3. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add more extensions
   - Each follows same pattern
   - Scales well
   - Reusable pattern

**Pattern:**

```
homeassistant_extension.py (Mini-ISP facade)
├── Public API for Lambda
├── Imports gateway for infrastructure
└── Routes to internal implementations

home_assistant/ (Internal implementations)
├── Can import each other
├── Use gateway for infrastructure
└── Hidden from external access
```

**Example:**

```python
# homeassistant_extension.py (Facade)
from gateway import log_info, http_post

def turn_on_light(entity_id):
    log_info(f"Turning on light: {entity_id}")
    from home_assistant.lights import turn_on
    return turn_on(entity_id)

def get_state(entity_id):
    from home_assistant.states import get
    return get(entity_id)

# home_assistant/lights.py (Internal)
from gateway import http_post

def turn_on(entity_id):
    return http_post("/api/services/light/turn_on", {
        "entity_id": entity_id
    })
```

**Benefits:**
- Lambda code simple: `from homeassistant_extension import turn_on_light`
- Extension internals isolated
- Can refactor home_assistant/ without affecting Lambda
- Same pattern as main architecture

**Rationale:**
Applying the ISP pattern consistently across extensions maintains architectural coherence and makes the codebase predictable.

## PART 5: TESTING DECISIONS

### Decision 18: Interface-Level Mocking
**REF:** NM04-DEC-18
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM
**TAGS:** testing, mocking, isolation, unit-tests
**KEYWORDS:** mock testing, test isolation, interface mocks
**RELATED:** NM07-DT-08, NM07-DT-09

**What:** Mock at interface router level for testing

**Why:**

1. **Isolation**
   - Test one interface without others
   - Mock gateway calls to other interfaces
   - Clear test boundaries
   - Predictable test behavior

2. **Speed**
   - No real HTTP calls in tests
   - No real file I/O
   - Fast test execution (<100ms per test)
   - Can run thousands of tests quickly

3. **Determinism**
   - Control mock responses exactly
   - No flaky tests from external services
   - Reproducible test results
   - Stable CI/CD pipeline

4. **Flexibility**
   - Can test error conditions
   - Can test edge cases
   - Can test timeouts
   - Can test any scenario

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Fast, isolated, deterministic tests
- Con: Need to maintain mocks
- Con: Mocks can diverge from reality
- **Decision:** Test speed and reliability critical

**Mock Strategy:**

```python
# test_cache.py
from unittest.mock import patch

def test_cache_set_with_logging():
    with patch('gateway.log_info') as mock_log:
        with patch('gateway.cache_set', return_value=True):
            result = cache_set("key", "value")
            
            # Verify behavior
            assert result == True
            mock_log.assert_called_once()
```

**Mocking Levels:**

1. **Unit tests:** Mock all gateway calls
2. **Integration tests:** Mock only external services (HTTP, SSM)
3. **E2E tests:** Mock nothing (full system)

**Rationale:**
Interface-level mocking provides the right balance between isolation and realism. Tests run fast and reliably while still catching integration issues.

**Why:**

1. **AI Assistant Understanding**
   - Claude (or future AI) can reference these
   - Provides complete context quickly
   - Reduces search overhead
   - Enables intelligent assistance

2. **New Developer Onboarding**
   - Complete architectural reference
   - Not just "what" but "why"
   - Decision rationale preserved
   - Faster learning curve

3. **Maintenance Knowledge**
   - Prevents re-litigating decisions
   - Documents trade-offs considered
   - Preserves institutional knowledge
   - Reduces technical debt

4. **Evolution Support**
   - Understand why things are as they are
   - Make informed changes
   - Avoid breaking implicit contracts
   - Maintain architectural coherence

**Structure:**

```
NM00: Gateway (Quick Index, Master Index)
NM01: Core Architecture (Interfaces, patterns)
NM02: Dependencies (Import rules, layers)
NM03: Operations (Flows, pathways)
NM04: Decisions (Why things are this way) ← THIS FILE
NM05: Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)
NM06: Learned Experiences (Bugs, lessons)
NM07: Decision Logic (Decision trees)
```

**Benefits:**

- **Claude:** Can answer "why" questions accurately
- **Developers:** Learn system quickly
- **Maintenance:** Understand implications of changes
- **Evolution:** Make informed architectural decisions

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Complete knowledge preservation, AI-accessible, maintainable
- Con: Requires writing time (~40 hours for complete system)
- Con: Must keep synchronized with code
- **Decision:** Long-term benefits outweigh upfront cost

**Measurement:**

- Without neural maps: ~2-3 days for new developer to understand system
- With neural maps: ~4-6 hours to understand system
- ROI: Pays for itself after 3rd developer

**Rationale:**
Neural maps are an investment in maintainability and knowledge preservation. They enable AI assistants like Claude to provide intelligent, context-aware help and dramatically reduce onboarding time.
