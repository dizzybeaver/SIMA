# SIMAv4 Directory Verification Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Status:** Awaiting Verification  
**Location:** https://claude.dizzybeaver.com/sima

---

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**File Count Discrepancy:**
- Phase completion documents state: **255 files total**
- Directory structure document shows: **248 files**
- Missing: **7 files**

**Root Cause:**
Combined lesson files (like LESS-27-39, LESS-34-38-42, LESS-26-35) were split into individual files in separate sessions, but the split files weren't reflected in the Phase 10.3 count of 69 files.

---

## USER ACTION (IN PROGRESS)

1. Creating complete directory structure locally
2. Deploying to: https://claude.dizzybeaver.com/sima
3. Will include ALL actual files (both combined and split versions)

---

## NEXT SESSION TASK

**When user returns:**

1. **Verify deployed structure** at https://claude.dizzybeaver.com/sima
2. **Count all actual files** in each directory
3. **Identify any missing files** by comparing to Phase completion documents
4. **Create missing files** if needed
5. **Update directory structure document** with accurate counts

---

## KEY FILES TO CHECK

**Lessons directory** - most likely location of discrepancy:
- `/sima/entries/lessons/core-architecture/` - Check for LESS-33 through LESS-41 (may be split)
- `/sima/entries/lessons/operations/` - Check for LESS-27, LESS-39, LESS-34, LESS-38, LESS-42 (were split)
- `/sima/entries/lessons/optimization/` - Check for LESS-26, LESS-35 (were split)
- `/sima/entries/lessons/learning/` - Check for LESS-43, LESS-44 (may be split)

---

## COMPLETION CRITERIA

- ✅ All directories verified
- ✅ All files counted accurately
- ✅ Missing files created (if any)
- ✅ Directory structure document updated
- ✅ Total file count matches actual deployment

**Next Session:** Verification and completion
