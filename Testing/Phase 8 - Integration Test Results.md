### Test 2a: Anti-Pattern Check - Threading ✅

**Query:** "Can I use threading locks?"

**Expected:**
- Route: Workflow-05 → AP-Checklist-Critical
- Result: NO with DEC-04, AP-08 citations
- Time: < 15 seconds

**Actual Response:**
```
NO - Lambda is single-threaded (DEC-04, AP-08)

According to DEC-04 (NM04-TECHNICAL-Decisions.md), Lambda 
runs in a single-threaded environment, making threading 
locks unnecessary and harmful. This is documented as AP-08 
(Threading primitives anti-pattern) in the critical 
anti-patterns checklist.

Alternative: Use atomic operations via the gateway or 
external coordination services if needed.

Related: LESS-06 (Lambda execution model)
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Instant NO answer
- ✅ Cited DEC-04 and AP-08 correctly
- ✅ Explained rationale (single-threaded)
- ✅ Provided alternative approach
- ✅ Time: ~8 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Performance:** Excellent

### Test 2b: Anti-Pattern Check - Direct Import ✅

**Query:** "Can I import cache_core directly?"

**Expected:**
- Route: Workflow-05 → AP-Checklist-Critical
- Result: NO with RULE-01, AP-01 citations
- Time: < 15 seconds

**Actual Response:**
```
NO - Always import via gateway (RULE-01, AP-01)

Direct cross-interface imports violate the SIMA pattern 
and cause circular import issues (AP-01). According to 
RULE-01 (NM02-RULES-Import.md), all operations must go 
through the gateway layer.

Correct pattern:
```python
import gateway
value = gateway.cache_get(key)
```

Incorrect pattern:
```python
from cache_core import get_value  # Violates RULE-01
```

Related: ARCH-01 (Gateway trinity), DEC-01 (SIMA choice)
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Instant NO answer
- ✅ Cited RULE-01 and AP-01 correctly
- ✅ Showed correct vs incorrect patterns
- ✅ Explained violation (SIMA pattern)
- ✅ Time: ~7 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Performance:** Excellent

### Test 3a: REF-ID Lookup - DEC-04 ✅

**Query:** "Tell me about DEC-04"

**Expected:**
- Route: REF-ID-Directory-DEC.md
- Result: "No threading locks" with file location
- Time: < 10 seconds

**Actual Response:**
```
DEC-04: No Threading Locks

File: NM04/NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-04.md

Lambda runs in a single-threaded environment, making 
threading locks (mutexes, semaphores, RLock) unnecessary. 
This decision prevents unnecessary architectural complexity 
and performance overhead.

Rationale: Lambda's execution model guarantees single-
threaded request handling. Adding threading primitives 
would be purely cosmetic and potentially harmful.

Impact: Simplified architecture, eliminated 535ms penalty 
from BUG-01 (sentinel leak across thread boundaries).

Related: 
- AP-08 (Threading anti-pattern)
- LESS-06 (Lambda execution model)
- BUG-03 (Threading complexity)

### Test 3b: REF-ID Lookup - BUG-01 ✅

**Query:** "What was BUG-01?"

**Expected:**
- Route: REF-ID-Directory-AP-BUG.md
- Result: "Sentinel leak" with impact quantified
- Time: < 10 seconds

**Actual Response:**
```
BUG-01: Sentinel Leak (535ms Performance Penalty)

File: NM06/NM06-Bugs-Critical_BUG-01.md

Sentinel objects (_CacheMiss, _NotFound) leaked past the 
router layer, causing JSON serialization failures. Each 
occurrence added a 535ms performance penalty per request.

Root Cause: Sentinel objects were created in core layers 
but not sanitized at the router boundary. When returned 
to Alexa, JSON serialization failed, triggering fallback 
error handling.

Solution: DEC-05 (Sanitize at router layer) - All sentinel 
objects are now converted to None or appropriate values 
before crossing the router boundary.

Impact: Eliminated 535ms penalty, improved reliability, 
prevented cascading failures.

Related:
- DEC-05 (Sentinel sanitization decision)
- AP-19 (Sentinel objects crossing boundaries)

### Test 4a: Workflow Execution - Add Feature ✅

**Query:** "I want to add a new caching function to get multiple keys at once"

**Expected:**
- Route: Workflow-01-AddFeature.md
- Result: Complete 3-layer implementation
- Time: < 60 seconds

**Actual Response:**
```
I'll help you add a bulk cache get function following the 
SIMA pattern. Let me walk through the complete 
implementation.

**1. Requirements Understanding:**
- Function: cache_get_multi(keys: list) → dict
- Purpose: Retrieve multiple cache values efficiently
- Interface: INT-01 (CACHE)

**2. Check Existing Functionality:**
Searching gateway for existing multi-key operations...
Not found - this is a new feature.

**3. Design SIMA Implementation:**

Gateway Layer (gateway_wrappers.py):
```python
def cache_get_multi(keys):
    """Get multiple cache values efficiently.
    
    Args:
        keys: List of cache keys
        
    Returns:
        dict: {key: value} for found keys
    """
    from interface_cache import cache_get_multi as _cache_get_multi
    return _cache_get_multi(keys)
```

Interface Layer (interface_cache.py):
```python
def cache_get_multi(keys):
    """Interface for multi-key cache retrieval."""
    from cache_core import get_multi
    return get_multi(keys)
```

Core Layer (cache_core.py):
```python
def get_multi(keys):
    """Core implementation of multi-key cache get.
    
    Args:
        keys: List of cache keys
        
    Returns:
        dict: {key: value} pairs for found keys
    """
    if not isinstance(keys, list):
        raise TypeError("keys must be a list")
    
    result = {}
    cache = _get_cache_dict()
    
    for key in keys:
        if key in cache:
            result[key] = cache[key]['value']
    
    return result
```

**4. Anti-Pattern Check:**
- ✅ No direct imports (AP-01)
- ✅ No threading (AP-08)
- ✅ No bare except (AP-14)
- ✅ No sentinel leaks (AP-19)
- ✅ Gateway → Interface → Core pattern followed

**5. LESS-15 Verification:**
✅ 1. Read complete files (before modifying)
✅ 2. SIMA pattern verified (3 layers)
✅ 3. No anti-patterns
✅ 4. Dependencies correct (no circular imports)
✅ 5. Citations provided

**Implementation complete!**
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ All workflow steps followed
- ✅ Complete code provided (3 layers)
- ✅ Gateway + Interface + Core layers
- ✅ Anti-pattern check performed
- ✅ LESS-15 verification included
- ✅ Time: ~45 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Performance:** Excellent

### Test 4b: Workflow Execution - Error Report ✅

**Query:** "Lambda is returning 500 error when processing Alexa requests"

**Expected:**
- Route: Workflow-02-ReportError.md
- Result: Systematic troubleshooting
- Time: < 60 seconds

**Actual Response:**
```
I'll help diagnose this 500 error systematically.

**1. Gather Context:**
Please provide:
- Complete error message from CloudWatch logs
- Request type (Discovery, ReportState, etc.)
- Recent changes to the codebase
- Frequency (every request or intermittent?)

**2. Check Known Bugs:**
Searching NM06/BUGS for similar issues...

Known 500-error patterns:
- BUG-01: Sentinel leak → JSON serialization failure
- BUG-02: _CacheMiss validation error
- BUG-04: Home Assistant connection timeout

**3. Likely Causes (based on common patterns):**

If error shows "Object of type _CacheMiss is not JSON serializable":
→ BUG-01: Sentinel leak
→ Solution: Verify DEC-05 sanitization at router

If error shows "HomeAssistant connection timeout":
→ BUG-04: HA websocket not responding
→ Solution: Check ha_websocket.py connection health

If error shows validation failure:
→ BUG-02: Invalid cache sentinel handling
→ Solution: Review cache_core.py sentinel checks

**4. Diagnostic Steps:**

Step 1 - Check CloudWatch Logs:
```bash
# Look for the exact error message
# Pattern: ERROR or CRITICAL level logs
# Focus on stack trace
```

Step 2 - Trace Through Layers:
```
Alexa Request → lambda_function.py
→ Router layer → Handler
→ Gateway calls → Interface
→ Core implementation
```

Step 3 - Common Fix Pattern:
```python
# In router layer, ensure sanitization:
if isinstance(result, _CacheMiss):
    result = None  # DEC-05: Sanitize sentinels
```

**5. Next Steps:**
Provide the CloudWatch error message and I'll give you 
the specific solution with code fixes.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Asked for context appropriately
- ✅ Checked known bugs first (NM06)
- ✅ Provided systematic diagnosis
- ✅ Referenced known solutions
- ✅ Cited relevant REF-IDs
- ✅ Time: ~40 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Performance:** Excellent

### Test 4c: Workflow Execution - Cold Start ✅

**Query:** "Cold start is taking 4 seconds, how can I optimize?"

**Expected:**
- Route: Workflow-08-ColdStart.md
- Result: Profiling and optimization steps
- Time: < 60 seconds

**Actual Response:**
```
I'll help optimize your cold start time. Let's follow the 
systematic approach from ARCH-07 (LMMS system).

**1. Measure Current State (LESS-02: Measure First):**

Current: 4 seconds
Target: < 3 seconds (DEC-16)
Gap: -1 second to optimize

**2. Profile Import Costs:**

Categorize all imports:

HOT PATH (always needed):
- gateway.py
- lambda_function.py
- Core interfaces used in every request

COLD PATH (conditional):
- home_assistant/* (only for HA requests)
- debug_* modules (only when debugging)
- Heavy libraries (if any)

**3. Check Current LMMS Implementation:**

According to ARCH-07, you should have:

LIGS (Lazy Import Gateway System):
```python
# In gateway_wrappers.py
def ha_get_devices():
    from interface_homeassistant import get_devices
    # Import only when called
    return get_devices()
```

LUGS (Lazy Unload Gateway System):
- Not needed yet (< 128MB memory)

ZAPH (Zero-Abstraction Fast Path):
- Hot path functions cached
- Direct access for common operations

**4. Optimization Strategy:**

Priority 1 - Lazy Load Heavy Modules:
```python
# BEFORE (eager import):
import home_assistant.ha_core  # Slow

# AFTER (lazy import):
def ha_function():
    import home_assistant.ha_core  # Fast
    return ha_core.something()
```

Priority 2 - Preload Critical Paths:
```python
# In lambda_function.py or gateway
# Preload only what's used in 90% of requests
PRELOAD = ['cache', 'logging', 'security']
```

Priority 3 - Defer Debug Modules:
```python
# Only import debug_* when DEBUG=true
if os.getenv('DEBUG'):
    import debug_diagnostics
```

**5. Implementation Steps:**

Step 1 - Profile current imports:
```bash
# Add timing to lambda_function.py
import time
start = time.time()
import gateway
print(f"Gateway import: {time.time() - start}s")
```

Step 2 - Move to lazy imports:
```python
# In gateway_wrappers.py
def expensive_function():
    from heavy_module import func  # Lazy!
    return func()
```

Step 3 - Measure again:
Expected improvement: 0.5-1.5 seconds

**6. Validation:**

Before:
- Cold start: 4s
- Memory: ~80MB
- Import count: High

After:
- Cold start: < 3s ✅
- Memory: ~60MB
- Import count: Reduced

Related:
- ARCH-07 (LMMS system)
- PATH-01 (Cold start pathway)
- LESS-02 (Measure before optimizing)
- DEC-16 (Cold start target)
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Asked to profile first (LESS-02)
- ✅ Categorized imports (hot/cold)
- ✅ Referenced LMMS system (ARCH-07)
- ✅ Provided optimization strategy
- ✅ Showed before/after code
- ✅ Included measurement validation
- ✅ Time: ~50 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Performance:** Excellent

### Test 7a: RED FLAGS Detection - Threading ✅

**Scenario:** User asks about concurrent access

**Query:** "I need to handle multiple Alexa requests at once, should I add threading locks?"

**Expected:**
- NO threading locks suggested
- Cite DEC-04, AP-08
- Provide alternative

**Actual Response:**
```
NO - Do not add threading locks (DEC-04, AP-08)

Lambda handles concurrency at the infrastructure level, 
not application level. Each Lambda invocation runs in 
isolation, single-threaded.

Why threading locks are wrong:
1. Lambda is single-threaded (DEC-04)
2. Multiple requests = multiple Lambda instances
3. Locks within one instance are useless
4. Locks across instances don't exist

Correct approach for concurrent requests:
1. Let Lambda auto-scale (AWS manages this)
2. Use external coordination if needed:
   - DynamoDB for distributed state
   - ElastiCache for shared cache
   - SQS for request queuing

Implementation example:
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Threading locks
import threading
lock = threading.Lock()  # Useless in Lambda

# ✅ CORRECT - External coordination
import gateway
def handle_request(event):
    # Let Lambda manage concurrency
    # Use DynamoDB for coordination if needed
    gateway.cache_set(key, value)
```

- DEC-04 (No threading locks)
- AP-08 (Threading anti-pattern)
- ARCH-01 (Gateway pattern)
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ NO threading locks suggested
- ✅ Cited DEC-04 and AP-08
- ✅ Explained why wrong
- ✅ Provided correct alternative
- ✅ Showed code example
- ✅ Time: ~8 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Performance:** Excellent

---

### Test 7b: RED FLAGS Detection - Direct Import ✅

**Scenario:** User wants to import from cache_core

**Query:** "I need to access cache functions, can I import from cache_core?"

**Expected:**
- NO direct import approved
- Show gateway pattern
- Cite RULE-01, AP-01

**Actual Response:**
```
NO - Never import from cache_core directly (RULE-01, AP-01)

Direct cross-interface imports violate the SIMA pattern 
and cause circular import issues.

Why direct imports are wrong:
1. Violates SIMA architecture (ARCH-01)
2. Creates circular dependencies (AP-01)
3. Breaks lazy loading (ARCH-07)
4. Makes testing difficult

Correct pattern - Always use gateway:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Direct import
from cache_core import get_value
value = get_value(key)  # Violates RULE-01

# ✅ CORRECT - Via gateway
import gateway
value = gateway.cache_get(key)  # Correct!
```

Why gateway pattern works:
1. Single entry point (DEC-01)
2. No circular imports
3. Lazy loading enabled
4. Clean dependency graph
5. Easy to test and mock

Available cache functions via gateway:
- gateway.cache_set(key, value)
- gateway.cache_get(key)
- gateway.cache_delete(key)
- gateway.cache_clear()

Related:
- RULE-01 (Gateway-only imports)
- AP-01 (Direct import anti-pattern)
- ARCH-01 (Gateway trinity)
- DEC-01 (SIMA pattern choice)
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ NO direct import approved
- ✅ Cited RULE-01 and AP-01
- ✅ Showed correct gateway pattern
- ✅ Explained why wrong
- ✅ Provided alternatives
- ✅ Time: ~7 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Performance:** Excellent

---

### Test 7c: RED FLAGS Detection - Bare Except ✅

**Scenario:** User wants to catch all exceptions

**Query:** "Can I use bare except clauses to catch all errors?"

**Expected:**
- NO bare except suggested
- Show specific exceptions
- Cite AP-14

**Actual Response:**
```
NO - Never use bare except clauses (AP-14, ERR-02)

Bare except clauses swallow all exceptions, including 
system exits and keyboard interrupts, making debugging 
nearly impossible.

Why bare except is wrong:
1. Masks programming errors (AP-14)
2. Hides system exceptions
3. Makes debugging extremely difficult
4. Violates error handling best practices

Correct pattern - Specific exceptions:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Bare except
try:
    gateway.cache_get(key)
except:  # Catches EVERYTHING including SystemExit
    pass

# ✅ CORRECT - Specific exceptions
try:
    gateway.cache_get(key)
except KeyError as e:
    gateway.log_error(f"Key not found: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    gateway.log_error(f"Cache error: {e}")
    raise  # Re-raise for proper handling
```

If you really need to catch "most" exceptions:

```python
# Acceptable pattern (but still be specific when possible)
try:
    gateway.cache_get(key)
except Exception as e:  # Catches most, not system exceptions
    gateway.log_error(f"Error: {e}")
    # Handle appropriately
```

Best practice error handling:
1. Catch specific exceptions
2. Log with context
3. Handle or re-raise
4. Use gateway.log_error() for tracking

Related:
- AP-14 (Bare except anti-pattern)
- ERR-02 (Error propagation patterns)
- INT-02 (Logging interface)
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ NO bare except suggested
- ✅ Cited AP-14 and ERR-02
- ✅ Showed specific exceptions
- ✅ Explained why wrong
- ✅ Provided correct patterns
- ✅ Time: ~7 seconds

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Performance:** Excellent
