## PART 1: CORE ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Single Universal Gateway Architecture (SUGA)
**REF:** NM04-DEC-01
**PRIORITY:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**TAGS:** SUGA, gateway, architecture, circular-imports, centralization, lazy-loading
**KEYWORDS:** single gateway, universal gateway, SUGA pattern, central control, import prevention
**RELATED:** NM01-ARCH-01, NM02-RULE-01, NM06-BUG-02, NM07-DT-01

**What:** All cross-interface communication flows through one gateway

**Why:**
1. **Circular Import Prevention**
   - Without gateway: Module A imports B, B imports C, C imports A = circular
   - With gateway: All import from gateway, gateway loads lazily = no circles
   - Benefit: Architecturally impossible to create circular dependencies

2. **Centralized Infrastructure**
   - Without gateway: Each module implements logging, caching, HTTP separately
   - With gateway: One implementation, everyone uses it
   - Benefit: Consistency, no duplication, easier maintenance

3. **Lazy Loading Control**
   - Without gateway: All imports happen at module load time
   - With gateway: Modules imported only when operations called
   - Benefit: Faster cold starts, lower memory usage

4. **Single Point of Control**
   - Without gateway: Changes require updating many files
   - With gateway: Changes in one place affect all users
   - Benefit: Easier to modify, test, and debug

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Prevents circular imports, centralized control, lazy loading
- Con: Slightly more indirection (extra function calls)
- Con: Gateway becomes critical dependency (but that's the point)
- **Decision: Benefits far outweigh minimal overhead**

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Direct imports: Rejected due to circular import issues
- Multiple gateways: Rejected due to complexity and confusion
- No gateway (everyone implements own): Rejected due to duplication

**Rationale:** The 5-10ms overhead per operation is negligible compared to preventing circular imports and reducing code duplication by ~80%.

**REAL-WORLD USAGE:**
User: "Why can't I just import cache_core directly?"
Claude searches: "SUGA gateway architecture"
Finds: NM04-DEC-01
Response: "SUGA architecture requires all cross-interface communication through gateway to prevent circular imports..."

### Decision 2: ISP Network Topology (Interface Isolation)
**REF:** NM04-DEC-02
**PRIORITY:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**TAGS:** ISP, interface-isolation, network-topology, boundaries, testability, firewall
**KEYWORDS:** interface segregation, isolated interfaces, ISP pattern, clean boundaries
**RELATED:** NM01-ARCH-03, NM02-DEP-01, NM04-DEC-01, NM05-AP-01

**What:** Interfaces are isolated "islands" connected only via gateway

**Why:**
1. **Clear Boundaries**
   - Each interface is self-contained module
   - Can't accidentally reach into other interfaces
   - Easy to understand what depends on what

2. **Testability**
   - Mock gateway calls to test in isolation
   - Don't need other interfaces running to test one interface
   - Clear interface contracts

3. **Maintainability**
   - Changes within interface don't affect others
   - Can rewrite entire interface without touching others
   - Easy to add/remove interfaces

4. **Circular Import Prevention (Layer 2)**
   - Even if gateway allowed it, architecture prevents it
   - Interface routers act as firewalls
   - Impossible to import other interface internals

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Clear boundaries, isolated testing, maintainable
- Con: Must use gateway for cross-interface (extra hop)
- Con: More files (router per interface)
- **Decision: Architectural clarity worth the structure**

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Flat structure (no routers): Rejected, too easy to violate boundaries
- Namespace packages: Rejected, adds Python complexity
- Monolithic modules: Rejected, hard to maintain and test

**Rationale:** The "firewall" pattern from networking prevents architectural violations at design level, not just by convention.

**REAL-WORLD USAGE:**
User: "Can I have cache_core import http_client_core directly?"
Claude searches: "ISP interface isolation"
Finds: NM04-DEC-02
Response: "No - ISP topology requires interfaces to be isolated islands. Use gateway for cross-interface communication."

### Decision 3: Dispatch Dictionary Pattern
**REF:** NM04-DEC-03
**PRIORITY:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**TAGS:** dispatch-dict, O(1), performance, if-elif, routing, pattern
**KEYWORDS:** dictionary dispatch, hash lookup, operation routing, constant time
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-01, NM07-DT-07, NM01-ARCH-03

**What:** Use dictionaries for operation routing instead of if/elif chains

**Why:**
1. **Performance**
   - Dictionary lookup: O(1) constant time
   - if/elif chain: O(n) linear time (average n/2 comparisons)
   - With 20 operations: Dict = 1 lookup, if/elif = ~10 comparisons

2. **Maintainability**
   - Add operation: Add one dict entry
   - Remove operation: Remove one dict entry
   - vs modifying long if/elif chain

3. **Readability**
   - Dictionary is data structure (clear mapping)
   - if/elif is control flow (harder to scan)
   - Dictionary can be generated from metadata

4. **Consistency**
   - Same pattern in all routers
   - Easy to understand any interface
   - Pattern is teachable and repeatable

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: O(1) lookup, cleaner code, maintainable
- Con: Slightly more memory (dictionary overhead ~1KB)
- Con: One extra indirection (function reference lookup)
- **Decision: Performance and clarity worth minimal memory cost**

**Measurement:**
- 30 operations: if/elif = avg 15 comparisons
- 30 operations: dict = 1 hash lookup
- Performance gain: ~10-15x for large operation sets
- Memory cost: ~3KB per interface router

**Alternatives Considered:**
- if/elif chains: Rejected due to O(n) performance
- Switch statements: Python doesn't have them (3.10+ match is similar)
- Function attributes: Rejected due to complexity

**Rationale:** Dictionary pattern reduced gateway_core from 100+ lines of if/elif to 12-line registry (90% reduction).

**REAL-WORLD USAGE:**
User: "Should I use if/elif or dispatch dict for routing?"
Claude searches: "dispatch dictionary pattern"
Finds: NM04-DEC-03
Response: "Always use dispatch dictionaries - O(1) vs O(n), 90% code reduction, consistent pattern."

### Decision 4: No Threading Locks
**REF:** NM04-DEC-04
**PRIORITY:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**TAGS:** threading, locks, Lambda, single-threaded, performance, YAGNI, concurrency
**KEYWORDS:** no locks, no threading, single thread, synchronization, mutex, race condition
**RELATED:** NM05-AP-08, NM06-LESS-04, NM07-DT-07
**ALIASES:** "why no locks", "threading in lambda", "do I need locks", "synchronization"

**What:** No threading.Lock() or similar synchronization primitives anywhere

**Why:**
1. **Lambda Environment**
   - AWS Lambda is single-threaded per container
   - One request = one thread = one execution context
   - No concurrent access to data structures

2. **Simplicity**
   - No lock acquisition overhead
   - No deadlock concerns
   - No race condition complexity

3. **Performance**
   - Lock acquisition: ~100-500ns per operation
   - Eliminates overhead completely
   - Memory: No lock objects needed

4. **Correctness**
   - Locks are for concurrency that doesn't exist
   - Adding locks would be defensive programming against nothing
   - YAGNI principle: You Aren't Gonna Need It

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Simpler code, no deadlocks, better performance
- Con: Code not reusable in multi-threaded environment
- Con: Must document this assumption
- **Decision: Lambda constraint makes this correct choice**

**Documentation:**
- Every core file documents "No locks needed: Lambda is single-threaded"
- DESIGN DECISION sections explain rationale
- Neural map files document this pattern

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Add locks "just in case": Rejected, adds complexity for no benefit
- Asyncio: Rejected, Lambda is synchronous, no benefit
- Thread pools: Rejected, Lambda is single-threaded

**Rationale:** Adding locks would be cargo cult programming - doing something because "that's what you do" without understanding why.

**REAL-WORLD USAGE:**
User: "Should I add threading.Lock() to cache_core?"
Claude searches: "threading locks Lambda"
Finds: NM04-DEC-04
Response: "No - Lambda is single-threaded per container. Locks add complexity for zero benefit. This is documented design decision."

### Decision 5: Sentinel Objects for Cache Miss Detection
**REF:** NM04-DEC-05
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**TAGS:** sentinel, cache-miss, None-handling, object, type-safety, sanitization
**KEYWORDS:** sentinel pattern, cache sentinel, _CACHE_MISS, None distinction
**RELATED:** NM06-BUG-01, NM03-PATH-01, NM01-INT-01

**What:** Use `_CACHE_MISS = object()` to distinguish None value from cache miss

**Why:**
1. **The None Problem**
   ```python
   # Without sentinel:
   cached = cache_get("key")  # Returns None
   # Is it cache miss? Or is None the cached value?
   # Can't tell!
   
   # With sentinel:
   cached = cache_get("key")  # Returns None (sanitized)
   if cached is None:  # Definitely a cache miss
       # Fetch from source
   ```

2. **Type Safety**
   - Can cache any value including None
   - Sentinel is never equal to any user value
   - `object()` creates unique instance

3. **Performance**
   - Sentinel check is identity comparison: O(1)
   - Alternative (default parameter): requires user to pass default always
   - Cleaner API for users

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Can cache any value, clear semantics, performant
- Con: Must sanitize at router layer to prevent leaks
- Con: Internal complexity (but abstracted from users)
- **Decision: User API clarity worth internal complexity**

**Critical Implementation Detail:**
- Sentinel MUST be sanitized at interface_cache.py (router layer)
- If leaked to user code, causes ~535ms cold start penalty
- Router responsibility: Infrastructure concern, not core concern

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Default parameter: Rejected, every call needs `default=None`
- Raise exception on miss: Rejected, exceptions shouldn't be control flow
- Special value (e.g., -1): Rejected, can't cache that value
- Tuple return (value, found): Rejected, awkward API

**Rationale:** Python's `object()` sentinel is industry standard pattern for distinguishing "no value" from "value is None".

**REAL-WORLD USAGE:**
User: "Why does cache return None instead of raising KeyError?"
Claude searches: "sentinel cache miss"
Finds: NM04-DEC-05
Response: "Sentinel pattern distinguishes cache miss from cached None value. Sanitized to None at router layer for clean API."

### Decision 6: Flat Project Structure (No Subdirectories)
**REF:** NM04-DEC-06
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM
**TAGS:** flat-structure, file-organization, historical, imports, simplicity
**KEYWORDS:** no subdirectories, flat files, root directory, file layout
**RELATED:** NM01-ARCH-05, NM02-RULE-04

**What:** All files in root directory (except Home Assistant extension)

**Why:**
1. **Historical Context**
   - Subdirectories were phased out long ago
   - Flat structure proven to work for this project
   - Simpler import paths

2. **Import Simplicity**
   - `from gateway import X` (no path complexity)
   - `from cache_core import Y` (direct import)
   - No `sys.path` manipulation needed

3. **Lambda Deployment**
   - Flat structure simpler to package
   - No directory structure to preserve in zip
   - Fewer things to go wrong

4. **File Discovery**
   - All project files in one place
   - Easy to see complete codebase
   - Simple to navigate

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Simple imports, easy discovery, proven approach
- Con: Many files in one directory (~30+ files)
- Con: Can't group related files visually
- **Decision: Proven pattern, works well for project scale**

**Exception: Home Assistant Extension**
- homeassistant_extension.py (facade in root)
- home_assistant/ subdirectory (internals)
- Rationale: Substantial extension with many files, needs organization

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Subdirectories per interface: Rejected, historical decision
- Module packages: Rejected, adds import complexity
- Namespace packages: Rejected, Python version concerns

**Rationale:** "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - flat structure has worked throughout project evolution.

### Decision 7: 128MB RAM Limit (Free Tier Constraint)
**REF:** NM04-DEC-07
**PRIORITY:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**TAGS:** 128MB, RAM-limit, free-tier, Lambda, constraints, memory-management, efficiency
**KEYWORDS:** memory constraint, 128MB limit, free tier, Lambda memory
**RELATED:** NM05-AP-09, NM06-LESS-02, NM07-DT-04

**What:** Design everything to work within AWS Lambda free tier 128MB RAM limit

**Why:**
1. **Cost Constraint**
   - Free tier = no ongoing costs
   - 128MB is Lambda minimum
   - Must be efficient with memory

2. **Design Discipline**
   - Forces lean implementations
   - No heavy libraries (pandas, numpy)
   - Careful about object lifetime

3. **Performance**
   - Less memory = faster garbage collection
   - Smaller memory footprint = lower cold start
   - Efficient code is fast code

**Impact on Design:**
1. **No Heavy Libraries**
   - Use stdlib instead of requests (urllib)
   - No pandas, numpy, scipy
   - JSON serialization, not pickle (lighter)

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Import modules only when needed
   - Gateway lazy loads interface routers
   - Reduces baseline memory usage

3. **Efficient Data Structures**
   - Dispatch dictionaries (small overhead)
   - No caching of large objects
   - Clear cache entries when done

4. **Memory Monitoring**
   - Track cache sizes
   - Implement TTL for automatic cleanup
   - Prevent memory leaks

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Free (no cost), forces efficiency, better performance
- Con: Can't use convenient heavy libraries
- Con: Must implement some things manually
- **Decision: Free tier + efficiency worth the constraints**

**Measurement:**
- Typical cold start: ~1200ms, ~40MB RAM
- Typical warm execution: ~50ms, ~60MB RAM  
- Peak usage: ~80MB RAM
- Headroom: ~48MB available

**Alternatives Considered:**
- 256MB tier: Rejected, costs money, we don't need it
- 512MB tier: Rejected, way more than needed
- Optimize for 128MB: **CHOSEN**, works well

**Rationale:** Constraints breed creativity. The 128MB limit forced efficient design that performs better than unlimited approaches.

**REAL-WORLD USAGE:**
User: "Can I use pandas for data processing?"
Claude searches: "128MB constraint heavy libraries"
Finds: NM04-DEC-07
Response: "No - 128MB RAM limit excludes heavy libraries. Use stdlib alternatives or implement lightweight version."

## PART 2: INTERFACE-SPECIFIC DECISIONS

### LOGGING: Why print() instead of logging module?
**REF:** NM04-DEC-08
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**TAGS:** logging, print, CloudWatch, Lambda, stdlib, simplicity
**KEYWORDS:** print vs logging, CloudWatch integration, stdout logging
**RELATED:** NM01-INT-02, NM05-AP-07

**What:** Use print() to stdout, not Python's logging module

**Why:**
1. **Lambda CloudWatch Integration**
   - Lambda captures stdout/stderr automatically
   - Appears in CloudWatch Logs immediately
   - No logging configuration needed

2. **Simplicity**
   - print() is zero-configuration
   - logging module requires setup (handlers, formatters)
   - Fewer dependencies

3. **Performance**
   - print() is faster than logging module
   - No handler chain traversal
   - No formatting overhead unless needed

4. **JSON Output**
   - Can print structured JSON directly
   - CloudWatch Logs Insights can parse JSON
   - Better than logging module's string formatting

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Simple, fast, works perfectly with Lambda
- Con: Less flexible than logging module
- Con: Can't easily change log levels at runtime
- **Decision: Simplicity and Lambda integration win**

**Alternatives Considered:**
- logging module: Rejected, unnecessary complexity
- structlog: Rejected, external dependency
- print() with JSON: **CHOSEN**, perfect for Lambda

### CACHE: Why TTL-based expiration?
**REF:** NM04-DEC-09
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**TAGS:** cache, TTL, expiration, memory-management, freshness
**KEYWORDS:** time to live, cache expiration, TTL strategy
**RELATED:** NM01-INT-01, NM07-DT-04

**What:** Cache entries have time-to-live (TTL) and expire automatically

**Why:**
1. **Memory Management**
   - Lambda container may live minutes/hours
   - Stale data must be cleared automatically
   - No manual cache invalidation needed

2. **Data Freshness**
   - External data changes over time
   - TTL ensures periodic refresh
   - Balance between caching and freshness

3. **Simple Model**
   - Set TTL on cache_set()
   - Automatic cleanup in background (optional)
   - Clear API for users

**TTL Strategy:**
- Short TTL (60s): Fast-changing data (API responses)
- Medium TTL (300s): Moderate-changing data (config)
- Long TTL (600s): Slow-changing data (reference data)
- No TTL: Never expires (user must delete manually)

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Automatic memory management, fresh data
- Con: May evict data that's still useful
- Con: Requires periodic cleanup (minor overhead)
- **Decision: Memory safety worth occasional re-fetch**

**Alternatives Considered:**
- LRU eviction only: Rejected, stale data can accumulate
- Manual invalidation only: Rejected, error-prone
- TTL + LRU: **CHOSEN** (hybrid approach)

---

### HTTP_CLIENT: Why urllib instead of requests?
**REF:** NM04-DEC-10
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**TAGS:** HTTP, urllib, requests, stdlib, dependencies, Lambda
**KEYWORDS:** urllib vs requests, standard library, no dependencies
**RELATED:** NM01-INT-08, NM04-DEC-07, NM05-AP-09

**What:** Use urllib (stdlib) instead of popular requests library

**Why:**
1. **Lambda Availability**
   - requests not in Lambda environment by default
   - urllib is Python stdlib (always available)
   - No external dependency to manage

2. **Memory Footprint**
   - requests + dependencies: ~5MB
   - urllib: included in Python, ~0MB additional
   - Significant in 128MB constraint

3. **Simplicity**
   - requests is convenient but heavyweight
   - urllib covers 90% of needs
   - Less attack surface (fewer dependencies)

4. **Sufficient Features**
   - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE: âœ“ urllib has these
   - JSON handling: âœ“ Manual but simple
   - SSL/TLS: âœ“ urllib supports
   - Connection pooling: Not needed in short-lived Lambda

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: No dependency, smaller footprint, stdlib
- Con: More verbose API than requests
- Con: Manual JSON encoding/decoding
- **Decision: Stdlib availability + memory win**

**Exception: Home Assistant Extension**
- homeassistant_extension uses requests library
- Rationale: Home Assistant client library requires it
- Trade-off: Worth it for that specific use case

**Alternatives Considered:**
- requests library: Rejected except for HA extension
- urllib: **CHOSEN**, perfect fit for constraints
- http.client: Rejected, too low-level

### SECURITY: Why validation-first approach?
**REF:** NM04-DEC-11
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**TAGS:** security, validation, fail-fast, input-sanitization
**KEYWORDS:** validate first, input validation, security pattern
**RELATED:** NM01-INT-03, NM07-DT-05

**What:** Validate all inputs at entry points before processing

**Why:**
1. **Fail Fast**
   - Catch invalid inputs immediately
   - Don't waste time processing bad data
   - Clear error messages at validation point

2. **Security**
   - Prevent injection attacks (SQL, command, etc.)
   - Sanitize user input before use
   - Defense in depth

3. **Clear Errors**
   - Validation errors are clear and actionable
   - User knows exactly what's wrong
   - Better than cryptic errors deep in code

4. **Performance**
   - Cheap validation prevents expensive processing
   - Regex validation: microseconds
   - vs processing bad data: milliseconds or error

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Security, performance, clear errors
- Con: Every entry point needs validation
- Con: Slightly more code at boundaries
- **Decision: Security and clarity worth the code**

**Validation Layers:**
1. Gateway wrapper: Basic type checking
2. Interface router: Parameter validation
3. Core implementation: Business logic validation
4. Security interface: Deep validation (URL, email, etc.)

---

### CONFIG: Why multi-tier configuration?
**REF:** NM04-DEC-12
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM
**TAGS:** config, tiers, deployment, flexibility, defaults
**KEYWORDS:** configuration tiers, deployment modes, config levels
**RELATED:** NM01-INT-05

**What:** Four configuration tiers: minimum, standard, maximum, user

**Why:**
1. **Deployment Flexibility**
   - Different environments need different configs
   - Development: minimum (fast, low resource)
   - Production: standard (balanced)
   - High-traffic: maximum (performance)
   - Custom: user (overrides)

2. **Sensible Defaults**
   - Most users can use standard tier
   - No configuration needed out of box
   - Can tune when needed

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - Minimum: 2MB cache, 60s TTL (development)
   - Standard: 8MB cache, 300s TTL (production)
   - Maximum: 24MB cache, 600s TTL (high-load)
   - Right-size resources for use case

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with minimum, scale up as needed
   - Easy to experiment with tiers
   - Clear upgrade path

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Flexible, sensible defaults, right-sizing
- Con: More configuration complexity
- Con: Need to document tiers
- **Decision: Flexibility worth the structure**

**Tier Selection:**
```python
# Environment variable or default
tier = os.environ.get('CONFIG_TIER', 'standard')
config = load_config_tier(tier)
```

## PART 3: PERFORMANCE DECISIONS

### Decision: Fast Path Caching
**REF:** NM04-DEC-13
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM
**TAGS:** performance, fast-path, optimization, caching, hot-path
**KEYWORDS:** fast path, performance optimization, hot operations
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-02, NM07-DT-07

**What:** Cache frequently-called operation routes to bypass lookups

**Why:**
1. **Hot Path Optimization**
   - Some operations called frequently (cache_get, log_info)
   - Normal path: 5 function calls + 2 dict lookups
   - Fast path: 3 function calls + 0 dict lookups

2. **Transparent to Users**
   - Automatically enabled after N calls
   - No code changes needed
   - Pure optimization

3. **Measured Impact**
   - ~40% faster for hot operations
   - Minimal memory cost (~1KB per cached route)
   - Significant benefit for frequent operations

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Significant performance gain, transparent
- Con: Slightly more memory, complexity in gateway_core
- Con: Cached routes don't reflect runtime changes
- **Decision: Performance gain worth the complexity**

**Threshold:** 10 calls before enabling fast path
- Rationale: Avoids caching one-time operations
- Balance: Not too aggressive, not too conservative

---

### Decision: Lazy Loading
**REF:** NM04-DEC-14
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**TAGS:** lazy-loading, import, cold-start, performance, memory
**KEYWORDS:** lazy import, deferred loading, import optimization
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-02, NM04-DEC-07

**What:** Import interface routers only when first operation called

**Why:**
1. **Cold Start Performance**
   - Import time is ~10ms per interface
   - 12 interfaces = ~120ms if all imported upfront
   - Lazy loading: Only import what's used

2. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Unused interfaces not loaded
   - Lower baseline memory footprint
   - Important in 128MB constraint

3. **Initialization Speed**
   - Lambda cold start already slow (~1200ms)
   - Every millisecond counts
   - Lazy loading saves ~60ms average (only 6 interfaces typically used)

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Faster cold start, lower memory, pay-per-use
- Con: First call to interface slightly slower
- Con: More complex import logic
- **Decision: Cold start performance critical**

**Measurement:**
- Eager loading (all 12): ~120ms import time
- Lazy loading (avg 6): ~60ms import time
- Savings: ~60ms per cold start

## PART 4: ERROR HANDLING DECISIONS

### Decision: Router-Level Exception Catching
**REF:** NM04-DEC-15
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**TAGS:** error-handling, exceptions, routers, logging, reliability
**KEYWORDS:** exception catching, router errors, error logging
**RELATED:** NM03-PATH-02, NM05-AP-14, NM07-DT-05

**What:** Interface routers catch exceptions and log before re-raising

**Why:**
1. **Guaranteed Logging**
   - Even if exception propagates, it's logged
   - Log happens before error goes up stack
   - Don't lose error information

2. **Structured Error Response**
   - Can transform exception to error dict
   - Consistent error format across interfaces
   - Easier for callers to handle

3. **Cross-Interface Logging**
   - Router can log via gateway.log_error
   - Logging happens even if LOGGING interface broken
   - Defensive programming

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Reliable logging, structured errors
- Con: Exception caught and re-raised (slight overhead)
- Con: Try/except in every router
- **Decision: Reliability worth the overhead**

**Pattern:**
```python
try:
    return handler(**kwargs)
except Exception as e:
    log_error(f"Error in {operation}: {e}", error=e)
    raise  # or return error dict
```

---

### Decision: Import Error Protection
**REF:** NM04-DEC-16
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
**TAGS:** import-protection, error-handling, graceful-degradation, robustness
**KEYWORDS:** import errors, try except imports, protected imports
**RELATED:** NM06-BUG-04, NM03-PATH-03

**What:** Try/except around imports in interface routers

**Why:**
1. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Missing implementation doesn't crash Lambda
   - Other interfaces continue working
   - Clear error message

2. **Deployment Robustness**
   - Partial deployments don't break everything
   - Can detect missing files immediately
   - System continues in degraded mode

3. **Development Safety**
   - Syntax errors in one interface don't break all
   - Can debug one interface while others work
   - Better development experience

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Robust, graceful degradation, clear errors
- Con: Complexity in import logic
- Con: May hide import errors temporarily
- **Decision: Robustness in production critical**

**Pattern:**
```python
try:
    from cache_core import _execute_get_implementation
    _CACHE_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError as e:
    _CACHE_AVAILABLE = False
    _IMPORT_ERROR = str(e)
```

## PART 5: EXTENSION DECISIONS

### Decision: Home Assistant as Mini-ISP
**REF:** NM04-DEC-17
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM
**TAGS:** extension, Home-Assistant, Mini-ISP, consistency, isolation
**KEYWORDS:** extension pattern, HA extension, mini ISP
**RELATED:** NM01-ARCH-05, NM04-DEC-01

**What:** Home Assistant extension follows same ISP pattern at smaller scale

**Why:**
1. **Consistency**
   - Developers understand pattern already
   - Same architectural principles
   - Easy to maintain

2. **Isolation**
   - Extension internals hidden behind facade
   - Lambda imports only facade
   - Clean boundary

3. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add more extensions
   - Each follows same pattern
   - Scales well

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Consistent, maintainable, scalable
- Con: More files per extension
- Con: Indirection layer
- **Decision: Consistency worth the structure**

**Pattern:**
```
homeassistant_extension.py (Mini-ISP facade)
â”œâ”€ Public API for Lambda
â”œâ”€ Imports gateway for infrastructure
â””â”€ Routes to internal implementations

home_assistant/ (Internal implementations)
â”œâ”€ Can import each other
â”œâ”€ Use gateway for infrastructure
â””â”€ Hidden from external access
```

## PART 6: TESTING DECISIONS

### Decision: Interface-Level Mocking
**REF:** NM04-DEC-18
**PRIORITY:** ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM
**TAGS:** testing, mocking, isolation, unit-tests
**KEYWORDS:** mock testing, test isolation, interface mocks
**RELATED:** NM07-DT-08, NM07-DT-09

**What:** Mock at interface router level for testing

**Why:**
1. **Isolation**
   - Test one interface without others
   - Mock gateway calls to other interfaces
   - Clear test boundaries

2. **Speed**
   - No real HTTP calls in tests
   - No real file I/O
   - Fast test execution

3. **Determinism**
   - Control mock responses exactly
   - No flaky tests from external services
   - Reproducible test results

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Fast, isolated, deterministic tests
- Con: Need to maintain mocks
- Con: Mocks can diverge from reality
- **Decision: Test speed and reliability critical**

**Mock Strategy:**
```python
# Mock gateway calls
with patch('gateway.log_info'):
    with patch('gateway.cache_get', return_value=None):
        result = cache_set("key", "value")
```

## PART 7: DOCUMENTATION DECISIONS

### Decision: Neural Map Synthetic Memory
**REF:** NM04-DEC-19
**PRIORITY:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**TAGS:** documentation, neural-maps, synthetic-memory, knowledge-preservation
**KEYWORDS:** neural maps, documentation system, knowledge base
**RELATED:** NM00-TRIG-ALL, NM01-ARCH-ALL

**What:** Build comprehensive neural map files documenting architecture

**Why:**
1. **AI Assistant Understanding**
   - Claude (or future AI) can reference these
   - Provides complete context quickly
   - Reduces search overhead

2. **New Developer Onboarding**
   - Complete architectural reference
   - Not just "what" but "why"
   - Decision rationale preserved

3. **Maintenance Knowledge**
   - Prevents re-litigating decisions
   - Documents trade-offs considered
   - Preserves institutional knowledge

4. **Living Documentation**
   - Updated as architecture evolves
   - Always current with code
   - Extensible structure

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Complete context, onboarding, knowledge preservation
- Con: Must maintain alongside code
- Con: Additional documentation burden
- **Decision: Long-term knowledge preservation critical**

**Structure:**
- Phase 1: Foundation (structure, dependencies, flow)
- Phase 2: Wisdom (decisions, anti-patterns, experiences)
- Phase 3+: Domain-specific knowledge (future)

## END NOTES

This Design Decisions file captures the "why" behind SUGA-ISP architecture. Every significant decision has rationale, trade-offs, and alternatives considered.

When questioning a design choice, refer to this file for context. When proposing changes, consider if the original reasoning still applies.

**Remember:** Good architecture isn't about following rules, it's about making informed trade-offs for your specific constraints and goals.
