## Summary

After achieving pattern mastery, traditional estimation methods break down due to non-linear efficiency gains. Work that initially took hours can be completed in minutes, creating 4-6x variance between estimates and actuals. Post-mastery estimates should use 0.3x-0.5x multipliers, not 1.0x.

---

## Context

**Universal Pattern:**
When learning new patterns, initial velocity provides reasonable basis for estimation. However, after pattern mastery develops, estimation accuracy collapses because muscle memory eliminates thinking time and pattern recognition becomes automatic.

**Why This Matters:**
Using learning-phase velocities for post-mastery estimates causes systematic over-estimation, poor resource planning, and missed opportunities.

### The Estimation Breakdown Phenomenon

**Estimation Accuracy Trajectory:**

| Phase | Estimate Method | Accuracy | Typical Variance |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------------|
| **Learning** | Time actual work | High | 0.8-1.2x |
| **Applying** | Adjust for learning curve | Medium | 1.5-2.5x |
| **Mastery** | Still using learning velocity | **Poor** | **4-6x** |
| **Calibrated** | Use mastery multipliers | High | 0.8-1.2x |

### Real Example: Pattern Mastery Impact

**Learning Phase (Components 1-2):**
```
Estimate: 2 hours per component
Actual: 2 hours per component
Variance: 1.0x ‚úÖ Accurate
```

**Mastery Phase (Component 10):**
```
Estimate: 3 hours (added complexity assumed)
Actual: 0.5 hours (30 minutes!)
Variance: 6.0x ‚ùå Estimation model broken
```

### The New Estimation Model

**Post-Mastery Multipliers:**

| Component Status | Complexity | Base Multiplier | Example |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Already compliant | Simple | 0.2x | 3h ‚Üí 36 min |
| Already compliant | Medium | 0.3x | 3h ‚Üí 54 min |
| Needs work | Simple | 0.4x | 3h ‚Üí 1.2h |
| Needs work | Medium | 0.5x | 3h ‚Üí 1.5h |
| Needs work | Complex | 0.7x | 3h ‚Üí 2.1h |

### Calibration Protocol

**Step 1: Track Actual vs. Estimate**
```
After each work unit:
- Record estimated time
- Record actual time
- Calculate variance ratio
- Document component status
```

**Step 2: Calculate Running Multiplier**
```
Over last 3-5 units:
Average variance = Sum(Actual/Estimate) / Count

Example:
Unit 3: 1h / 2h = 0.5x
Unit 4: 0.5h / 3h = 0.17x
Unit 5: 1.2h / 3h = 0.4x
Average: (0.5 + 0.17 + 0.4) / 3 = 0.36x

Use 0.36x for next estimate
```

### Key Insights

**Insight 1:**
Traditional estimation assumes linear velocity. Pattern mastery creates exponential efficiency gains that break linear models.

**Insight 2:**
The 4-6x variance is not estimation error‚Äîit's a signal that learning phase is complete and new model needed.

**Insight 3:**
Muscle memory is real and measurable: what required thought now requires none, eliminating 50-70% of execution time.
