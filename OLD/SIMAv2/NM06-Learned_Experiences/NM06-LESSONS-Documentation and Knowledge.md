## Lesson 11: Design Decisions Must Be Documented

**REF:** NM06-LESS-11  
**PRIORITY:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**TAGS:** documentation, knowledge-preservation, rationale, decisions, memory  
**KEYWORDS:** document decisions, preserve rationale, institutional knowledge, why decisions  
**RELATED:** NM04-DEC-19, NM05-AP-25, NM06-LESS-14

### The Problem

**6 months after making architectural decisions:**

```
Developer 1: "Why don't we use threading locks?"
Developer 2: "I... don't remember. Let me check the code."
[Searches code, finds no locks, but no explanation why]
Developer 2: "Maybe we forgot to add them?"

Developer 1: "Why is logging the base layer?"
Developer 2: "Good question. Seems arbitrary."
[Spends 2 hours re-deriving the reasoning]

Developer 1: "Why use gateway pattern instead of direct imports?"
Developer 2: "Not sure. Want to refactor it?"
[Considers removing pattern that prevents bugs]
```

**Result:**
- Re-litigating decisions already made
- Questioning good decisions
- Risk of undoing what works
- Lost institutional knowledge

### The Discovery

**Memory fades:**
- What seemed obvious in January is mysterious in June
- Rationale clear when designing, forgotten when maintaining
- Trade-offs understood at decision time, lost later
- Context that influenced decision disappears

**The code doesn't explain WHY:**
```python
# Code shows WHAT:
class GatewayInterface(Enum):
    CACHE = "cache"
    LOGGING = "logging"

# Code doesn't show WHY:
# - Why enum instead of strings?
# - Why gateway pattern at all?
# - What problem does this solve?
# - What alternatives were considered?
```

### The Solution

**Document decisions when made, not later:**

```markdown
# DECISION: Use Gateway Pattern for All Cross-Interface Communication

## Context
Lambda Execution Engine has 12 interfaces that need to communicate.
Direct imports between interfaces created circular dependency hell.

## Decision
All cross-interface calls route through gateway.py central hub.
Core modules (*_core.py) import nothing except stdlib.

## Rationale
1. Prevents circular imports (architecturally impossible)
2. Single point of aggregation (easier to understand)
3. Testable in isolation (core modules pure)
4. Consistent pattern (all interfaces work same way)

## Alternatives Considered
- Direct imports: Creates circular dependencies
- Lazy imports: Performance penalty, still fragile
- Dependency injection: Over-complicated for Lambda

## Consequences
- Positive: No circular imports, clean architecture
- Negative: One extra function call (negligible overhead)
- Trade-off: Accepted for architectural benefits

## Date: 2025.08.15
## Status: Implemented
```

### What to Document

**Document the WHY, not the WHAT:**

```markdown
‚ùå Bad documentation:
"This function gets a value from the cache."
(Code already says this)

‚úÖ Good documentation:
"Cache uses sentinel object internally to distinguish 'no value' from 
'value is None'. Router layer sanitizes sentinel to None before 
returning to users to prevent sentinel leaks (see NM06-BUG-01)."
(Explains WHY sanitization exists)
```

**Key questions to answer:**
1. What problem does this solve?
2. Why this approach instead of alternatives?
3. What trade-offs were accepted?
4. What constraints influenced the decision?
5. What happens if we remove/change this?

### Where to Document

**Decision Documentation Hierarchy:**

```
Level 1: SIMA Neural Maps (Architecture)
- High-level design decisions
- Cross-cutting patterns
- Rationale and trade-offs
Example: NM04-DEC-01 (Gateway Pattern)

Level 2: README files (Setup & Usage)
- How to deploy
- How to configure
- Common workflows
Example: README.md in repo root

Level 3: Docstrings (API Contracts)
- Function purpose
- Parameters and return types
- Exceptions raised
Example: Function docstrings

Level 4: Inline Comments (Tricky Logic)
- Why this specific implementation
- Edge cases handled
- Performance considerations
Example: "# Sentinel sanitization prevents BUG-01"
```

### The SIMA System as Solution

**This neural map system exists because:**
- Memory fades (decisions forgotten in 6 months)
- Context is lost (why decisions made)
- Knowledge is tribal (only in people's heads)
- Re-discovery is expensive (hours to re-derive reasoning)

**SIMA provides:**
- Permanent record of decisions
- Rationale preserved with decision
- Cross-references between related topics
- Searchable knowledge base
- Institutional memory that persists

### Real-World Impact

**Before SIMA documentation:**
```
Question: "Why no threading locks?"
Answer time: 2+ hours (re-derive reasoning)
Risk: Might add locks unnecessarily
```

**After SIMA documentation:**
```
Question: "Why no threading locks?"
Search: "threading locks" ‚Üí NM04-DEC-04
Answer time: 2 minutes (read documented decision)
Risk: Zero (decision explained with 4 reasons)
```

**Measured savings:**
- Average decision re-litigation time: 1-3 hours
- Frequency: 2-3 times per month
- Monthly savings: 3-9 hours
- Annual savings: 36-108 hours

### Key Principles

**1. Document When You Decide, Not Later**
```
‚ùå "I'll document this later"
(You'll forget the context)

‚úÖ "Let me write the decision doc while I remember"
(Context fresh, details accurate)
```

**2. Explain Trade-offs, Not Just Choices**
```
‚ùå "We chose approach A"
(Why not B or C?)

‚úÖ "We chose A over B (too complex) and C (too slow)"
(Shows alternatives were considered)
```

**3. Document What's NOT Done (and Why)**
```
‚ùå Only document what exists

‚úÖ Document "We considered X but rejected because Y"
(Prevents future developer suggesting X again)
```

**4. Link Decisions to Outcomes**
```
"This decision prevented: NM06-BUG-02 (circular imports)"
(Shows decision was correct)
```

## Lesson 12: Code Comments vs External Documentation

**REF:** NM06-LESS-12  
**PRIORITY:** üü¢ MEDIUM  
**TAGS:** documentation, comments, maintenance, best-practices, documentation-types  
**KEYWORDS:** comments vs docs, external documentation, comment maintenance, docstrings  
**RELATED:** NM05-AP-26, NM04-DEC-19, NM06-LESS-11

### The Discovery

**Comments in code get outdated:**

```python
# ‚ùå This comment is now WRONG:
def cache_get(key):
    """Returns string value or raises KeyError if not found."""
    # ^ Function no longer raises KeyError, returns None instead!
    return _cache_store.get(key, None)
```

**Why comments decay:**
1. Code changes, comments don't
2. No automated checking of comment accuracy
3. Developers focus on code, not comments
4. Comments are "second-class citizens"

### The Problem Pattern

**Misleading comments are worse than no comments:**

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG COMMENT (worse than none):
def process_request(data):
    """Process request synchronously."""
    # ^ This is actually async now!
    return await async_process(data)

# Developers trust comments, make wrong assumptions
# Bug: Caller doesn't await, gets coroutine instead of result
```

### The Solution

**Three-tier documentation strategy:**

```python
# Tier 1: DOCSTRINGS (API contracts - maintained)
def cache_get(key: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Get value from cache.
    
    Args:
        key: Cache key to retrieve
        
    Returns:
        Cached value if found, None if not found or error
        
    Examples:
        >>> cache_get('user:123')
        'john_doe'
        >>> cache_get('missing')
        None
    """
    return _cache_store.get(key, None)

# Tier 2: MINIMAL COMMENTS (only for tricky logic)
def _execute_cache_operation(operation, **kwargs):
    result = _dispatch[operation](**kwargs)
    
    # Sanitize sentinel to prevent BUG-01 leak
    if _is_sentinel(result):
        return None
    
    return result

# Tier 3: EXTERNAL DOCS (architecture, decisions)
# See: NM04-DEC-05 (Why sentinels used)
# See: NM06-BUG-01 (Sentinel leak incident)
```

### Comment Guidelines

**When to use comments:**

```python
‚úÖ GOOD: Explain WHY, not WHAT
# Sanitize sentinel to prevent user code from seeing internal object
if _is_sentinel(result):
    return None

‚úÖ GOOD: Warn about non-obvious behavior  
# IMPORTANT: This function modifies input dict
def update_config(config):
    config['timestamp'] = time.time()

‚úÖ GOOD: Explain complex algorithm
# Binary search: O(log n) lookup
# Better than linear scan for large datasets
low, high = 0, len(items) - 1

‚ùå BAD: Restate the obvious
# Set x to 5
x = 5

‚ùå BAD: Commented-out code
# def old_implementation():
#     pass

‚ùå BAD: TODOs that never get done
# TODO: Optimize this someday
```

### Docstring Guidelines

**API contracts belong in docstrings:**

```python
‚úÖ GOOD: Complete docstring
def cache_set(key: str, value: str, ttl: int = 300) -> bool:
    """Store value in cache with TTL.
    
    Args:
        key: Cache key (must be non-empty string)
        value: Value to store (any JSON-serializable type)
        ttl: Time-to-live in seconds (default: 300)
        
    Returns:
        True if stored successfully, False on error
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If key is empty or None
        
    Note:
        Values expire after TTL seconds.
        Expired values return None from cache_get().
    """
    if not key:
        raise ValueError("Key required")
    return _cache_store.set(key, value, ttl)

‚ùå BAD: Outdated docstring
def cache_set(key, value, ttl=300):
    """Store value."""  # Too brief, no detail
    # Function behavior changed but docstring didn't
```

### External Documentation (SIMA)

**Architecture and decisions in external docs:**

```markdown
Location: SIMA Neural Maps

Why External?
- Persists across code refactors
- Cross-references between topics
- Explains rationale, not just implementation
- Doesn't clutter code
- Easier to maintain (separate files)

What Goes Here?
- Design decisions (why gateway pattern?)
- Architecture explanations (how SIMA works?)
- Bug post-mortems (what went wrong?)
- Lessons learned (what we discovered?)
```

### The Hierarchy

```
EXTERNAL DOCS (SIMA Neural Maps)
- Architecture patterns
- Design rationale
- Trade-off analysis
- Historical context
Priority: High-level understanding

DOCSTRINGS (In code)
- Function contracts
- API documentation
- Parameter types
- Return values
Priority: Usage understanding

MINIMAL COMMENTS (In code)
- Tricky logic explanation
- Non-obvious behavior
- Edge case handling
Priority: Implementation understanding

NO COMMENTS
- Self-explanatory code
- Obvious statements
- Redundant information
Priority: Keep code clean
```

### Maintenance Strategy

**Docstrings checked by tests:**
```python
def test_cache_get_docstring_accuracy():
    """Verify cache_get behavior matches docstring."""
    # Test: "Returns None if not found"
    assert cache_get('missing') is None
    
    # Test: "Returns value if found"
    cache_set('key', 'value')
    assert cache_get('key') == 'value'
```

**Comments reviewed in code reviews:**
```
PR Review Checklist:
‚úÖ Are new comments necessary?
‚úÖ Do comments explain WHY not WHAT?
‚úÖ Are docstrings accurate?
‚ùå Any commented-out code?
‚ùå Any TODO comments without issues?
```

**External docs updated with architecture changes:**
```
When changing architecture:
1. Update code
2. Update SIMA neural maps
3. Link PR to neural map update
4. Mark old decisions as superseded
```

## Lesson 13: Architecture Must Be Teachable

**REF:** NM06-LESS-13  
**PRIORITY:** üü° HIGH  
**TAGS:** architecture, teachability, onboarding, communication, simplicity  
**KEYWORDS:** teachable architecture, explain architecture, onboarding, simplicity  
**RELATED:** NM04-DEC-19, NM04-DEC-01, NM06-LESS-11

### The Problem

**New contributors were confused:**

```
New Developer: "Why can't I just import cache_core directly?"
Answer: "Well, it's complicated... let me explain SUGA... I mean SIMA..."

New Developer: "What's the point of routers?"
Answer: "Umm... they route operations... but also sanitize... and..."

New Developer: "How do I add a new operation?"
Answer: "Let me find the documentation... actually, let me just show you..."
```

**Red flags that architecture is too complex:**
- Can't explain it in 5 minutes
- Different developers explain it differently
- Lots of "special cases" and "exceptions"
- Documentation exists but nobody reads it
- Easier to show than explain

### The Principle

**If you can't teach it, it's too complex.**

```
Good architecture:
- Explainable in a diagram
- Consistent patterns
- Few core concepts
- Examples make sense immediately

Bad architecture:
- Needs long explanation
- Many special cases
- Numerous concepts
- Examples confusing
```

### The SIMA Teaching Approach

**1. Start with Analogy (Familiar Concept)**

```
"SIMA is like a company organization:

Gateway = CEO office (single entry point)
‚Üì
Interfaces = Department managers (cache, logging, HTTP)
‚Üì
Cores = Workers (do actual work)

All communication through CEO ‚Üí Managers ‚Üí Workers.
Workers don't talk to each other directly."
```

**2. Show the Pattern (Concrete Example)**

```python
# User code:
result = gateway.cache_get('key')

# What happens:
gateway.cache_get()           # Gateway layer
    ‚Üì
interface_cache.execute_cache_operation('get', key='key')  # Interface
    ‚Üì
cache_core._execute_get_implementation(key='key')  # Core
    ‚Üì
return value
```

**3. Explain the Why (Motivation)**

```
Why this pattern?

Problem: Direct imports create circular dependencies
Solution: Gateway prevents circular deps (architecturally impossible)

Benefit: Can't make this mistake even if you try
```

**4. Provide Examples (Concrete Usage)**

```python
# Adding new cache operation (EASY):

# Step 1: Add implementation (core)
def _execute_delete_implementation(key):
    del _CACHE_STORE[key]

# Step 2: Add to dispatch (interface)
_OPERATION_DISPATCH['delete'] = _execute_delete_implementation

# Step 3: Add wrapper (gateway)
def cache_delete(key):
    return execute_operation(CACHE, 'delete', key=key)

# Done! Same pattern for ALL operations.
```

### Teaching Materials Created

**1. Visual Diagrams**
```
Gateway Layer (You import this)
    ‚Üì
Interface Layer (Routers dispatch here)
    ‚Üì
Core Layer (Business logic here)
```

**2. Pattern Templates**
```python
# Template for new interface:
_OPERATION_DISPATCH = {
    'operation1': _execute_operation1_implementation,
}

def execute_{interface}_operation(operation, **kwargs):
    impl = _OPERATION_DISPATCH.get(operation)
    return impl(**kwargs)
```

**3. Examples Repository**
```python
# examples/add_cache_operation.py
"""Example: How to add a new cache operation."""

# examples/add_new_interface.py
"""Example: How to add a new interface."""

# examples/cross_interface_call.py
"""Example: How to call one interface from another."""
```

**4. SIMA Neural Maps**
```
NM00A-Quick-Index: Fast answers to common questions
NM01-Architecture: Complete architectural overview
NM07-DecisionTrees: Decision flowcharts for common tasks
```

### The Teachability Test

**Can a new developer:**

```
‚úÖ Add new operation in < 30 minutes?
‚úÖ Understand gateway pattern in < 15 minutes?
‚úÖ Explain architecture to another developer?
‚úÖ Find answers in documentation?
‚úÖ Follow consistent patterns without help?

If NO to any: Architecture too complex or poorly documented
```

### Onboarding Checklist

**Day 1: Concepts**
```
‚ñ° Read: NM00A-Quick-Index (trigger patterns)
‚ñ° Read: NM01-ARCH-01 (Gateway Trinity)
‚ñ° Draw: Architecture diagram yourself
‚ñ° Explain: Gateway pattern to team
```

**Day 2: Hands-On**
```
‚ñ° Add: New cache operation (follow template)
‚ñ° Test: Your operation works
‚ñ° Review: Compare to existing operations
‚ñ° Understand: Why patterns are consistent
```

**Day 3: Deep Dive**
```
‚ñ° Read: NM04-DEC-01 (Why gateway pattern)
‚ñ° Read: NM06-BUG-02 (What it prevents)
‚ñ° Explore: All 12 interfaces
‚ñ° Task: Add operation to different interface
```

**Success Metric:**
```
Can new developer add operation independently by Day 3?
Yes = Architecture is teachable
No = Need better docs or simpler architecture
```

### Key Insights

**1. Consistency Aids Teaching**
```
All interfaces use dispatch dictionaries
‚Üí Learn once, apply everywhere
‚Üí No need to learn 12 different patterns
```

**2. Examples Beat Explanations**
```
Long explanation: Hard to understand
Working example: Immediately clear
```

**3. Architecture Should Be Obvious**
```
Good: "Oh, I see the pattern. All interfaces work the same."
Bad: "This interface is different because... wait, why is this one different?"
```

**4. Documentation is Part of Architecture**
```
Code + Docs = Complete Architecture
Great code with no docs = Unusable
Average code with great docs = Maintainable
```

## Synthesis: Documentation Wisdom

### The Three Pillars

**Pillar 1: Document Decisions (LESS-11)**
- Preserve WHY, not just WHAT
- Capture rationale when fresh
- Link decisions to outcomes
- SIMA provides permanent record

**Pillar 2: Separate Concerns (LESS-12)**
- Docstrings = API contracts
- Comments = Tricky logic only
- External docs = Architecture
- Each type has different purpose

**Pillar 3: Make it Teachable (LESS-13)**
- Architecture should be explainable
- Consistent patterns easier to learn
- Examples clarify concepts
- Test: Can new dev be productive quickly?

### How They Connect

```
Teachable Architecture (LESS-13)
    ‚Üì
Requires Good Documentation (LESS-12)
    ‚Üì
Especially Decision Rationale (LESS-11)
    ‚Üì
SIMA Provides All Three
```

### The SIMA Solution

**SIMA addresses all three lessons:**

1. **Documents decisions** with rationale (NM04 Design Decisions)
2. **Separates documentation types** (neural maps = architecture, docstrings = API)
3. **Makes architecture teachable** (consistent patterns, examples, references)

**Result:**
- Fast onboarding (< 3 days to productivity)
- No lost knowledge (decisions preserved)
- Easy maintenance (find answers quickly)
- Consistent quality (patterns documented)
