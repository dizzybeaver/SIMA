## Summary

NoSQL databases can model one-to-many relationships using item collections - groups of items sharing the same partition key. This enables efficient retrieval of related items with a single query, but requires careful key design to prevent partition hot spots and size limitations.

**Lesson:** Item collections are a powerful NoSQL pattern for 1:many relationships, but partition size and access patterns must be carefully managed to avoid bottlenecks.

---

## Context

SQL databases use foreign keys and joins to model relationships. NoSQL databases denormalize data and use partition keys to physically collocate related items. All items with the same partition key form an "item collection" and are stored together for fast retrieval.

**Problem Domain:** NoSQL data modeling, 1:many relationships, denormalization  
**Applicability:** DynamoDB, Cassandra, HBase, any partition-based NoSQL database

## The Lesson

### What Is an Item Collection?

**Definition:**
```
Item Collection = All items sharing the same partition key

Physical Reality:
  - Stored on same partition (physical server)
  - Retrieved together in single query
  - Fast access (local to partition)
  - Limited size (typically 10GB per partition)
```

**Structure:**
```
Partition Key: user_123 (shared)
├─ Sort Key: "PROFILE#metadata"    → User profile
├─ Sort Key: "ADDRESS#home"        → Home address
├─ Sort Key: "ADDRESS#work"        → Work address  
├─ Sort Key: "PAYMENT#card_001"    → Credit card
├─ Sort Key: "PAYMENT#card_002"    → Debit card
└─ Sort Key: "PREFERENCE#theme"    → UI preferences

Query: pk="user_123" → Returns ALL items (entire collection)
```

### Pattern: 1:Many Relationship Modeling

**Concept:**
Store related entities together using shared partition key and typed sort keys to differentiate entity types.

**Example 1: User Profile System**
```
Entity Relationship:
  User (1) → Addresses (many)
  User (1) → Payment Methods (many)
  User (1) → Preferences (many)

Item Collection Design:
  pk: user_id (same for all related items)
  sk: entity_type#entity_id (different per item)

Data:
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "PROFILE#main", data: {name, email...}}
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "ADDRESS#home", data: {street, city...}}
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "ADDRESS#work", data: {street, city...}}
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "PAYMENT#card_001", data: {last4, exp...}}
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "PAYMENT#card_002", data: {last4, exp...}}

Query Examples:
  1. Get entire user profile:
     Query(pk="user_123")
     → Returns all 5 items
  
  2. Get only addresses:
     Query(pk="user_123", sk begins_with "ADDRESS#")
     → Returns 2 address items
  
  3. Get specific address:
     Query(pk="user_123", sk="ADDRESS#home")
     → Returns 1 item
```

**Example 2: Order Management**
```
Entity Relationship:
  Order (1) → Line Items (many)
  Order (1) → Shipments (many)
  Order (1) → Payments (many)

Item Collection Design:
  pk: order_id
  sk: entity_type#entity_id

Data:
  {pk: "order_789", sk: "METADATA#order", data: {total, status...}}
  {pk: "order_789", sk: "ITEM#001", data: {product, qty, price...}}
  {pk: "order_789", sk: "ITEM#002", data: {product, qty, price...}}
  {pk: "order_789", sk: "ITEM#003", data: {product, qty, price...}}
  {pk: "order_789", sk: "SHIPMENT#ship_01", data: {tracking...}}
  {pk: "order_789", sk: "PAYMENT#pay_01", data: {amount, status...}}

Query Examples:
  1. Get complete order:
     Query(pk="order_789")
     → 6 items (metadata + items + shipment + payment)
  
  2. Get only line items:
     Query(pk="order_789", sk begins_with "ITEM#")
     → 3 line item records
  
  3. Calculate order total:
     Query(pk="order_789", sk begins_with "ITEM#")
     Sum(item.price * item.qty)
```

**Example 3: Gaming System (Hierarchical)**
```
Entity Relationship:
  Account (1) → Characters (many) → Equipment (many)

Item Collection Design:
  pk: account_id
  sk: hierarchical_path

Data:
  {pk: "account_456", sk: "ACCOUNT#metadata", data: {level, xp...}}
  {pk: "account_456", sk: "CHARACTER#warrior#stats", data: {hp, str...}}
  {pk: "account_456", sk: "CHARACTER#warrior#inventory::armor", data: {helmet, chest...}}
  {pk: "account_456", sk: "CHARACTER#warrior#inventory::weapons", data: {sword, shield...}}
  {pk: "account_456", sk: "CHARACTER#mage#stats", data: {mp, int...}}
  {pk: "account_456", sk: "CHARACTER#mage#inventory::armor", data: {robe...}}

Query Examples:
  1. Get all account data:
     Query(pk="account_456")
     → All characters and equipment
  
  2. Get warrior character:
     Query(pk="account_456", sk begins_with "CHARACTER#warrior#")
     → Warrior stats + inventory
  
  3. Get all inventories:
     Query(pk="account_456", sk contains "#inventory::")
     → All equipment across characters
```

### Benefits of Item Collections

**1. Single Query Retrieval**
```
Traditional SQL (3 queries):
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 123;
  SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE user_id = 123;
  SELECT * FROM payments WHERE user_id = 123;

NoSQL Item Collection (1 query):
  Query(pk="user_123")
  → Returns all related data in one operation
  
Performance: 3x faster (1 query vs 3)
Cost: 3x cheaper (1 query cost vs 3)
```

**2. Strong Data Locality**
```
Physical Storage:
  All items stored on same partition
  No network hops between items
  Sequential read optimization
  
Latency: 5-10ms (single partition access)
vs SQL joins: 20-50ms (multiple tables, indexes)
```

**3. Atomic Operations**
```
Transactions within partition:
  - Update multiple items atomically
  - Read consistent view of related data
  - Strong consistency available
  
Example:
  TransactWriteItems([
    Update(pk="user_123", sk="PROFILE#main", ...),
    Update(pk="user_123", sk="ADDRESS#home", ...),
    Update(pk="user_123", sk="PAYMENT#card_001", ...)
  ])
  → All updates succeed or all fail
```

**4. Efficient Filtering**
```
Sort key prefix queries:
  pk="user_123", sk begins_with "ADDRESS#"
  → Only addresses (no full collection scan)

Hierarchical queries:
  pk="account_456", sk begins_with "CHARACTER#warrior#"
  → All warrior data

Specific item:
  pk="user_123", sk="ADDRESS#home"
  → Single item lookup
```

### Constraints and Trade-offs

**Constraint 1: Partition Size Limit (10GB)**
```
Limit: 10GB per partition key value

Calculation Example:
  Average item size: 10KB
  Items per partition: 10GB / 10KB = ~1 million items
  
If exceeded:
  - Write operations throttled
  - Read operations slower
  - Hot partition issues

Prevention:
  ✅ Monitor partition size
  ✅ Archive old data
  ✅ Split large collections
```

**Constraint 2: Hot Partition Risk**
```
Problem: High access frequency on single partition

Example - Bad:
  pk="PRODUCT" (shared by all products!)
  sk=product_id
  → All product queries hit ONE partition

Example - Good:
  pk=product_id (unique per product)
  sk="METADATA#product"
  → Load distributed across partitions

Detection:
  - Throttling errors
  - High latency on specific keys
  - Uneven throughput distribution

Solution:
  - Use high-cardinality partition keys
  - Distribute load across partitions
  - Add random shard suffix if needed
```

**Constraint 3: Relationship Direction Matters**
```
Item collection only works in ONE direction

User (1) → Orders (many):
  ✅ pk=user_id, sk=order_id
  ✅ Query: Get user's orders → FAST
  ❌ Query: Get order's user → SLOW (must know user_id)

Solution: Duplicate data or use GSI
  Base table: pk=user_id, sk=order_id
  GSI: pk=order_id, sk=user_id
  → Both directions fast
```

### Design Patterns

**Pattern 1: Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)**
```
Flexible schema for sparse data:

Structure:
  pk: entity_id
  sk: attribute_name
  value: attribute_value

Example - Product catalog:
  {pk: "product_123", sk: "name", value: "Laptop"}
  {pk: "product_123", sk: "price", value: 999.99}
  {pk: "product_123", sk: "color", value: "silver"}
  {pk: "product_456", sk: "name", value: "Mouse"}
  {pk: "product_456", sk: "price", value: 29.99}
  (No "color" attribute for mouse)

Benefits:
  ✅ Flexible schema
  ✅ Sparse attributes OK
  ✅ Easy to add attributes

Drawbacks:
  ❌ More items per entity
  ❌ Harder to query across attributes
```

**Pattern 2: Composite Sort Key (Type#ID)**
```
Typed entities with unique IDs:

Structure:
  pk: parent_id
  sk: "TYPE#unique_id"

Example:
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "ADDRESS#uuid_1", ...}
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "ADDRESS#uuid_2", ...}
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "PAYMENT#uuid_3", ...}

Benefits:
  ✅ Clear entity types
  ✅ Prefix queries work
  ✅ Unique IDs prevent conflicts

Query patterns:
  - All addresses: sk begins_with "ADDRESS#"
  - Specific address: sk = "ADDRESS#uuid_1"
```

**Pattern 3: Hierarchical Path (Type::Subtype::ID)**
```
Multi-level relationships:

Structure:
  pk: root_id
  sk: "level1::level2::level3"

Example - Game inventory:
  {pk: "character_789", sk: "inventory::armor::helmet_01"}
  {pk: "character_789", sk: "inventory::armor::chest_02"}
  {pk: "character_789", sk: "inventory::weapons::sword_03"}
  {pk: "character_789", sk: "inventory::weapons::bow_04"}

Query patterns:
  - All inventory: sk begins_with "inventory::"
  - All armor: sk begins_with "inventory::armor::"
  - Specific item: sk = "inventory::armor::helmet_01"
```

### Anti-Patterns

**Anti-Pattern 1: Shared Partition Key Across Entities**
```
❌ WRONG:
  All users share pk="USER"
  {pk: "USER", sk: "user_123", ...}
  {pk: "USER", sk: "user_456", ...}
  (Single hot partition!)

✅ RIGHT:
  Each user has unique partition key
  {pk: "user_123", sk: "PROFILE#main", ...}
  {pk: "user_456", sk: "PROFILE#main", ...}
```

**Anti-Pattern 2: Uncontrolled Collection Growth**
```
❌ WRONG:
  No limit on items per partition
  User posts: pk=user_id, sk=post_id
  → Power user has 1M posts → 10GB limit exceeded!

✅ RIGHT:
  Time-based partitioning
  pk=user_id#year_month, sk=post_id
  → Distributes load across time partitions
```

**Anti-Pattern 3: Complex Relationships as Collection**
```
❌ WRONG:
  Many-to-many as item collection
  pk=user_id, sk=friend_id (who's the primary entity?)

✅ RIGHT:
  Duplicate in both directions or use GSI
  Table 1: pk=user_A, sk=friend_B
  Table 2: pk=user_B, sk=friend_A
  or
  GSI: pk=friend_B, sk=user_A
```

### When NOT to Use Item Collections

**Use Cases Where Collections Don't Fit:**
```
❌ Many-to-many relationships
   → Use link table or GSI

❌ Unbounded growth
   → Use time-based partitioning

❌ Cross-partition queries
   → Use GSI or separate table

❌ Equal importance relationships
   → No clear "parent" entity

❌ Frequently accessed individual items
   → Use item-per-partition instead
```

## Why This Matters

**Performance:**
- Item collections: 1 query for related data
- SQL joins: Multiple queries or expensive joins
- 3-10x faster retrieval for related data

**Cost:**
- Single query = lower cost
- Reduced network overhead
- Efficient storage (data locality)

**Data Consistency:**
- Atomic operations within partition
- Strong consistency for related items
- Transactional updates across collection

---

## When to Apply

**Design Phase:**
- ✅ Identify 1:many relationships
- ✅ Determine access patterns (query direction)
- ✅ Estimate collection sizes
- ✅ Plan for growth

**Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Collection approaching 1GB (monitor)
- ⚠️ 10,000+ items per partition (check performance)
- ⚠️ Hot partition errors (throttling)
- ⚠️ Need bidirectional queries (consider GSI)
