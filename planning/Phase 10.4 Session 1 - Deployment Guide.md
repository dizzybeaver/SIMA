## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### Step 1: Verify Directory Structure

```bash
ls -la /sima/entries/decisions/

# Should show:
drwxr-xr-x import/
drwxr-xr-x feature-addition/
drwxr-xr-x error-handling/
drwxr-xr-x testing/
drwxr-xr-x architecture/       # Existing from Phase 10.1
drwxr-xr-x technical/          # Existing from Phase 10.1
drwxr-xr-x operational/        # Existing from Phase 10.1
-rw-r--r-- Decisions-Master-Index.md  # Existing
```

### Step 2: Verify File Counts

```bash
# Import directory
ls -la /sima/entries/decisions/import/ | wc -l
# Should show: 3 files

# Feature Addition directory
ls -la /sima/entries/decisions/feature-addition/ | wc -l
# Should show: 3 files

# Error Handling directory
ls -la /sima/entries/decisions/error-handling/ | wc -l
# Should show: 3 files

# Testing directory
ls -la /sima/entries/decisions/testing/ | wc -l
# Should show: 3 files
```

### Step 3: Verify File Contents

```bash
# Check headers
head -20 /sima/entries/decisions/import/DT-01.md
head -20 /sima/entries/decisions/feature-addition/DT-03.md
head -20 /sima/entries/decisions/error-handling/DT-05.md
head -20 /sima/entries/decisions/testing/DT-08.md

# Check file sizes (should all be under 400 lines)
wc -l /sima/entries/decisions/import/*.md
wc -l /sima/entries/decisions/feature-addition/*.md
wc -l /sima/entries/decisions/error-handling/*.md
wc -l /sima/entries/decisions/testing/*.md
```

### Step 4: Verify Readability

```bash
# Test that files are readable
cat /sima/entries/decisions/import/DT-01.md > /dev/null
cat /sima/entries/decisions/feature-addition/DT-03.md > /dev/null
cat /sima/entries/decisions/error-handling/DT-05.md > /dev/null
cat /sima/entries/decisions/testing/DT-08.md > /dev/null

# If no errors, files are readable
```

## 🔗 Integration Verification

### Cross-References Check

**These files reference Session 1 files:**
- From Phase 10.1 files (DEC-##)
- From Phase 10.2 files (AP-##)
- From Phase 10.3 files (LESS-##)

**After deployment, verify:**
```bash
# Search for references to new DT files
grep -r "DT-01" /sima/entries/decisions/
grep -r "DT-03" /sima/entries/decisions/
grep -r "DT-05" /sima/entries/decisions/
grep -r "DT-08" /sima/entries/decisions/
```

## 📊 Deployment Statistics

**Files Deployed:** 12  
**Total Lines:** ~3,850  
**New Directories:** 4  
**Disk Space:** ~350 KB (estimated)

**File Breakdown:**
- Decision Trees: 8 files (DT-01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 08, 09)
- Category Indexes: 4 files

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Directory Already Exists
**Solution:** Check if directory is empty or contains old files. Backup if needed, then proceed.

### Issue: Permission Denied
**Solution:** Check permissions with `ls -la` and adjust with `chmod` if needed.

### Issue: File Too Large
**Solution:** All files verified under 400 lines - should not occur.

### Issue: Encoding Error
**Solution:** All files are UTF-8. Verify with `file` command.

---

## 🎯 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy Now (Partial Deployment)
**Pros:**
- Get 12 files into production immediately
- Start using import/feature/error/test decisions
- De-risk Session 2

**Cons:**
- Incomplete category coverage
- Master index not yet updated
- May need to update paths in Session 2

**Recommended:** Wait for Session 2 completion

### Option 2: Wait for Session 2 (Full Deployment)
**Pros:**
- Deploy all 26 files at once
- Complete master index update
- Single deployment event
- Less risk of file conflicts

**Cons:**
- Delay using Session 1 files

**Recommended:** ✅ YES - Wait for complete Phase 10.4
