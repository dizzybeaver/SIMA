AI Compatibility

Claude.ai - Was designed with Claude, so it works.

chat.deepseek.com - Does not have web fetch that can fetch files - so does not work

Qwen.ai - Does not have web fetch that can fetch files - so does not work

copilot.microsoft.com - Does not have web fetch that can fetch files - so does not work

chatgpt.com - So limited - I did not really try - With no subscription

gemini.google.com - So limited - I did not really try - with no subscription

Le Chat or chat.mistral.ai - promising compared to others has web fetch capabilities - Needs more testing

GLM-4.6 or Z.AI - Does not have web fetch that can fetch files - so does not work
