- **Related:** LESS-11, LESS-13
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

### LESS-13: Architecture Must Be Teachable
- **File:** `NM06-Lessons-Documentation_LESS-13.md`
- **Summary:** If you can't teach the architecture, it's too complex
- **Related:** LESS-11, ARCH-01, DEC-01
- **Priority:** HIGH

### LESS-31: Concurrent Documentation Prevents Drift
- **File:** `NM06-Lessons-Documentation_LESS-31.md`
- **Summary:** Documenting during work achieves 95-100% accuracy vs 70-80% post-session
- **Related:** LESS-11, LESS-54, LESS-12
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Added:** 2025-10-25

### LESS-54: Proactive Token Management Enables Quality Documentation
- **File:** `NM06-Lessons-Documentation_LESS-54.md`
- **Summary:** Stopping at 60% token usage enables comprehensive docs and 15-20 min savings next session
- **Related:** LESS-11, LESS-12, LESS-13, LESS-45, LESS-09, LESS-31
- **Priority:** HIGH

## Cross-Topic Relationships

**Related Topics:**
- CoreArchitecture (documents the principles being taught)
- Operations (LESS-15 verification requires understanding docs)
- Evolution (LESS-14 evolution needs documented rationale)
- Learning (LESS-45 benefits from quality documentation)
- Optimization (Time management enables quality, LESS-31 improves accuracy)

**Frequently Accessed Together:**
- When writing docs: LESS-11, LESS-12, LESS-13, LESS-31
- When planning sessions: LESS-54, LESS-31
- When onboarding: LESS-13, LESS-01
- When managing context: LESS-54 + session transitions
- When ensuring accuracy: LESS-31, LESS-11
