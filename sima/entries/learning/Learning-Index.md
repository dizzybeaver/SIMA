## Individual Files

### LESS-43: Traditional Estimation Fails After Pattern Mastery
- **File:** `LESS-43.md`
- **Summary:** Post-mastery estimates need 0.3x-0.5x multipliers due to non-linear gains
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 4-6x variance between learning and mastery phases

### LESS-44: Milestone Achievements Create Measurable Momentum
- **File:** `LESS-44.md`
- **Summary:** 50% milestone creates +25% velocity boost through psychological momentum
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 15-25% performance gains from strategic milestones

### LESS-45: First Independent Pattern Application Validates Learning
- **File:** `LESS-45.md`
- **Summary:** First independent application with 2x velocity validates knowledge transfer
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 50% improvement indicates successful learning

### LESS-47: Velocity Improvement Milestones Indicate Progress
- **File:** `LESS-47.md`
- **Summary:** First velocity improvement (session 3) predicts continued acceleration
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 50% improvement milestone validates approach

## Usage Patterns

**Learning Trajectory:**
1. **Sessions 1-2:** Learning phase (establish patterns)
2. **Session 3:** First independent (validate transfer) - LESS-45
3. **Monitor velocity improvements** - LESS-47
4. **Watch for 50% milestone** - LESS-44
5. **Recalibrate estimates** - LESS-43
6. **Sessions 4+:** Mastery phase

**Success Indicators:**
- Session 3 is 50% faster than Session 1 (LESS-45)
- 50% completion milestone achieved (LESS-44)
- Velocity milestones on track (LESS-47)
- Estimation variance stabilizes (LESS-43)
- Can apply patterns independently
- Minimal reference lookups needed

**For Training:**
```
Week 1: Learn patterns (Sessions 1-2)
Week 2: First independent application (Session 3) - LESS-45
        Validate 50% improvement - LESS-47
Week 3: Build momentum (hit 50% milestone) - LESS-44
Week 4: Mastery phase (recalibrate estimates) - LESS-43
```

**For Estimation:**
```
Learning phase: Use 1.0x baseline
Transition (after Session 3): Use 0.75x multiplier
Mastery (after Session 5): Use 0.3x-0.5x multiplier
Account for milestones: +15-25% boost at 50%
```
