## Individual Files

### LESS-45: First Independent Pattern Application Validates Learning
- **File:** `NM06-Lessons-Learning_LESS-45.md`
- **Summary:** First independent application with 2x velocity improvement indicates successful knowledge transfer
- **Related:** LESS-28, LESS-43, LESS-44, LESS-47, LESS-49
- **Priority:** HIGH

### LESS-47: Velocity Improvement Milestones Indicate Progress
- **File:** `NM06-Lessons-Learning_LESS-47.md`
- **Summary:** 50% improvement milestone validates learning investment and predicts continued acceleration
- **Related:** LESS-28, LESS-43, LESS-44, LESS-45, LESS-49
- **Priority:** HIGH

## Cross-Topic Relationships

**Related Topics:**
- Optimization & Velocity (LESS-49, LESS-50, LESS-51, LESS-52) - Practice patterns learned
- CoreArchitecture (LESS-46) - Complexity management learned in Session 3
- Performance (LESS-17, LESS-20, LESS-21) - Performance patterns to master
- Operations (LESS-15) - Verification protocols to internalize

**Frequently Accessed Together:**
- When training: LESS-45, LESS-47, LESS-49
- When assessing progress: LESS-45, LESS-47
- When planning: LESS-47 + velocity predictions

## Usage Patterns

**Learning Trajectory:**
1. Sessions 1-2: Learning phase (establish patterns)
2. Session 3: First independent (validate transfer) - LESS-45
3. Monitor velocity improvements - LESS-47
4. Sessions 4+: Mastery phase

**Success Indicators:**
- Session 3 is 50% faster than Session 1 (LESS-45)
- Velocity milestones achieved (LESS-47)
- Can apply patterns independently
- Minimal reference lookups needed
