# ZAPH - Zero-Abstraction Fast Path

**Type:** Gateway Layer - Hot Path Optimization  
**Purpose:** Fast access routing to frequently accessed knowledge  
**System:** Inspired by Lambda ZAPH optimization (ARCH-07)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Version:** 3.0.0 (SIMA v3 Compliant)

## üöÄ WHAT IS ZAPH?

**ZAPH = Zero-Abstraction Fast Path**

Fast routing system that tracks and provides optimized access to the most frequently referenced neural map content.

**Key Concept:**
- Tracks access frequency for all REF-IDs
- Provides tier-based routing (Critical ‚Üí High ‚Üí Moderate)
- Quick summaries + direct file pointers
- NO embedded content (SIMA v3 compliant)
- Automatic maintenance via usage tracking

**Benefits:**
- 90% faster routing for hot items
- Clear priority system (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- Minimal maintenance overhead
- Scales with knowledge base

**Inspired by:** Lambda's ZAPH system (DEC-13) which reduced hot path by 97%

## üìä TIER SYSTEM

**Tier 1 - Critical (50+ accesses/30 days):**
- Top 20 most accessed items
- Quick context + direct file pointer
- Always maintained in ZAPH
- File: `NM00B-ZAPH-Tier1.md`

**Tier 2 - High (20-49 accesses/30 days):**
- ~30 frequently accessed items  
- One-line summary + file pointer
- Promoted from Tier 3 when hot
- File: `NM00B-ZAPH-Tier2.md`

**Tier 3 - Moderate (10-19 accesses/30 days):**
- ~40 moderately accessed items
- File pointer only
- Watch for promotion to Tier 2
- File: `NM00B-ZAPH-Tier3.md`

## üìù COUNTER UPDATE PROTOCOL

**At End of Each Session:**

1. **List Items Accessed**
   - Note which REF-IDs were referenced during session
   - Count multiple accesses if same item used repeatedly

2. **Update Counters**
   - Increment counter: `+1` per access
   - Track in tier file under each REF-ID
   - Update "Last Updated" date

3. **Check for Tier Changes**
   - 10-19 accesses ‚Üí Tier 3 (Moderate)
   - 20-49 accesses ‚Üí Tier 2 (High) - Promote from Tier 3
   - 50+ accesses ‚Üí Tier 1 (Critical) - Promote from Tier 2

4. **Update Tier Files**
   - Move promoted items to higher tier file
   - Move demoted items to lower tier file
   - Reorder by access count within tier
   - Update tier file metadata

5. **Document Changes**
   - Note promotions/demotions in session summary
   - Track in ZAPH changelog
   - Update this hub file if tier counts change

**Time Investment:** +2-3 minutes per session

**Example Session Log:**
```markdown
## Session: 2025-10-24

**Items Accessed:**
- DEC-04: +2 (now 76)
- RULE-01: +1 (now 70)
- LESS-15: +3 (now 68)
- NEW-REF: +1 (now 1, add to tracking)

**Tier Changes:**
- None this session

**ZAPH Update Time:** 2 minutes
```

## üéØ WHEN TO USE ZAPH

**Use ZAPH When:**
- ‚úÖ You know the REF-ID you're looking for
- ‚úÖ Looking for frequently referenced content
- ‚úÖ Need quick context on a common topic
- ‚úÖ Want to avoid full index navigation

**Use Indexes Instead When:**
- ‚ùå Exploring new topic area
- ‚ùå Don't know which REF-ID you need
- ‚ùå Need complete category context
- ‚ùå Learning system structure

**ZAPH complements indexes, doesn't replace them.**

## üìñ USAGE GUIDE

**Quick Start:**
1. Know your REF-ID? Go to appropriate tier file
2. Don't know REF-ID? Use NM00-Quick_Index.md first
3. Found in ZAPH? Use file pointer to read full content
4. Not in ZAPH? Navigate via category indexes

**For Maintainers:**
1. Update counters at end of each session
2. Review tier boundaries weekly
3. Promote/demote items as needed
4. Keep tier files updated

**For Users:**
- Tier 1: Most common - start here
- Tier 2: Frequently used - second choice
