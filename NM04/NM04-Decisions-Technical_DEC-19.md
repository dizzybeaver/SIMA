# DEC-19: Neural Map Documentation System

## Summary

Use neural maps as synthetic memory system to preserve design knowledge including decisions, rationale, alternatives, and trade-offs for Claude and development team, preventing knowledge loss over time.

---

## Context

As the Lambda Execution Engine evolved, we made dozens of critical design decisions. Six months later, team members (and even original developers) couldn't remember why certain choices were made. "Why don't we use threading?" "Why the gateway pattern?" Questions that had clear answers at decision time became mysteries.

Traditional documentation (README files, code comments) failed to capture the full context: what alternatives were considered, what trade-offs were accepted, what evidence informed decisions. Without this knowledge, future changes risked undoing carefully considered decisions.

We needed a documentation system that preserves not just WHAT we built, but WHY we built it that way, for both human developers and AI assistants.

### The Decision

**What We Chose:**
Create comprehensive neural map documentation system that captures decisions, rationale, alternatives, trade-offs, bugs, lessons learned, and wisdom. Structure maps as interconnected knowledge base that Claude can search and understand.

**Structure:**
- **NM01:** Architecture (patterns, interfaces, core concepts)
- **NM02:** Dependencies (layers, rules, relationships)
- **NM03:** Operations (flows, pathways, execution)
- **NM04:** Decisions (design choices with full context) - this category!
- **NM05:** Anti-Patterns (what NOT to do and why)
- **NM06:** Lessons (bugs fixed, insights gained)
- **NM07:** Decision Logic (algorithms, trees, decision processes)

### Rationale

**Why We Chose This:**

1. **Preserves Institutional Knowledge:**
   - Design rationale doesn't disappear with team changes
   - Future developers understand context behind decisions
   - Six months later, still know why choices were made
   - Prevents "historical amnesia" in long-lived projects

2. **Enables Claude to Answer "Why" Questions:**
   - Claude can search neural maps for design rationale
   - Can explain trade-offs and alternatives considered
   - Provides context-rich answers, not just facts
   - Makes Claude genuinely helpful for architecture questions

3. **Captures Full Decision Context:**
   - **WHAT** was decided
   - **WHY** (multi-faceted rationale with evidence)
   - **ALTERNATIVES** considered and rejected
   - **TRADE-OFFS** accepted (costs and benefits)
   - **IMPACT** on architecture, development, performance
   - **FUTURE** considerations for revisiting

4. **Interconnected Knowledge Graph:**
   - Decisions reference lessons (BUG-01 led to DEC-05)
   - Lessons reference decisions (LESS-01 reinforces DEC-01)
   - Anti-patterns reference both (AP-08 violates DEC-04)
   - Rich web of cross-references aids understanding

5. **Living Documentation:**
   - Easy to update as system evolves
   - Can add new decisions, lessons, insights continuously
   - Grows with project rather than becoming stale
   - Documentation stays relevant

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: Traditional README Documentation**
- **Description:** Comprehensive README with all design decisions
- **Pros:**
  - Simple, standard approach
  - Easy to start
  - Familiar format
- **Cons:**
  - Becomes massive and unnavigable (>10,000 lines)
  - Hard to find specific information
  - Claude struggles with huge context
  - No cross-referencing structure
  - Quickly becomes outdated
- **Why Rejected:** Doesn't scale, hard to maintain, poor searchability

**Alternative 2: Code Comments Only**
- **Description:** Document decisions inline with code
- **Pros:**
  - Documentation right where code lives
  - Easy to keep in sync
  - Developers see context while coding
- **Cons:**
  - Limited space (comments get long)
  - No cross-file context
  - Can't explain architectural decisions (span multiple files)
  - Claude can't easily search comments
  - Fragments knowledge
- **Why Rejected:** Wrong level of granularity

**Alternative 3: External Wiki**
- **Description:** Confluence/GitHub Wiki for documentation
- **Pros:**
  - Purpose-built for documentation
  - Good search and organization
  - Familiar tools
- **Cons:**
  - Separate system (context switching)
  - Claude can't access (not in project files)
  - Requires manual synchronization
  - Often becomes outdated
  - Not version controlled with code
- **Why Rejected:** Claude can't access it, separate maintenance

**Alternative 4: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
- **Description:** Standard ADR format for decisions
- **Pros:**
  - Industry standard pattern
  - Well-defined structure
  - Proven approach
- **Cons:**
  - Only captures decisions (not lessons, bugs, patterns)
  - Limited cross-referencing
  - No support for wisdom/insights
  - Doesn't create knowledge graph
- **Why Rejected:** Too narrow, missing key knowledge types

### Trade-offs

**Accepted:**
- **Significant documentation effort:** Creating and maintaining neural maps takes time
  - But knowledge loss costs more long-term
  - One-time investment pays dividends
  - Can add incrementally

- **Learning curve:** Team needs to learn neural map structure
  - But structure is intuitive once learned
  - REF-ID system clear after examples
  - Cross-references become natural

- **File proliferation:** Many documentation files (130+ in SIMA v3)
  - But each file focused and manageable
  - Better than monolithic documentation
  - Easy to navigate with indexes

**Benefits:**
- **Knowledge preservation:** Nothing gets forgotten
- **Claude effectiveness:** Can answer "why" questions accurately
- **Faster onboarding:** New developers understand context quickly
- **Better decision-making:** Can revisit with full context
- **Reduced mistakes:** Anti-patterns prevent repeating errors

**Net Assessment:**
Absolutely critical. Neural maps are possibly the most important decision we made. They transform documentation from burden to asset, enable Claude to be genuinely helpful, and ensure institutional knowledge survives team changes.

### Impact

**On Architecture:**
- Creates documented rationale for all architectural choices
- Makes architecture accessible to new developers
- Enables informed evolution (know why before changing)

**On Development:**
- Developers understand "why" not just "what"
- Reduces "why is this here?" questions
- Makes code review more informed
- Improves decision quality

**On Performance:**
- No runtime impact (documentation only)
- But enables informed optimization (understand trade-offs)
- Prevents optimizations that break architectural principles

**On Maintenance:**
- Dramatically reduces knowledge loss
- Makes system maintainable long-term
- Enables confident refactoring
- Reduces tribal knowledge dependency

**On AI Assistance:**
- Enables Claude to provide context-rich answers
- Makes Claude actually helpful (not just plausible)
- Creates partnership between human + AI
- Demonstrates effective human-AI collaboration pattern

### Future Considerations

**When to Revisit:**
- If neural maps become too large (implement SIMA v3 atomization)
- If cross-references become unmanageable (tool support)
- If maintenance burden grows (automation)

**Potential Evolution:**
- **SIMA v3:** Atomized architecture (currently implementing)
- **Interactive visualization:** Graph of decisions/lessons
- **Automated updates:** Extract from code changes
- **Template enforcement:** Ensure consistency
- **Impact analysis:** Show decision consequences

**Monitoring:**
- Track neural map usage (how often searched)
- Measure time-to-answer for "why" questions
- Assess onboarding speed improvement
- Gather team feedback on usefulness
