## Topic Overview

**Description:** Anti-patterns related to testing practices that undermine code confidence. Covers both the absence of tests entirely and tests that exist but provide false confidence through missing assertions. Both patterns prevent catching bugs before production and create a culture where "working code" means "doesn't crash immediately."

**Keywords:** testing, assertions, test coverage, confidence, validation, regression prevention

**Priority Distribution:** 2 Medium

## Individual Files

### AP-23: No Tests for New Features
- **File:** `NM05-AntiPatterns-Testing_AP-23.md`
- **Summary:** Write tests BEFORE marking feature complete - no exceptions
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Impact:** Unknown regression risk, fear of refactoring, accumulating bugs, deployment anxiety

### AP-24: Tests Without Assertions
- **File:** `NM05-AntiPatterns-Testing_AP-24.md`
- **Summary:** Every test must verify something - use specific assertions
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Impact:** False confidence, silent failures, bugs not caught, wasted effort

## Common Themes

Both testing anti-patterns address **false confidence**. AP-23 is the absence of tests leading to "hope-based deployment." AP-24 is worse - tests that exist but don't verify anything, creating the illusion of safety while catching nothing.

**The Testing Hierarchy of Failure:**
1. **No tests** (AP-23) - You know you're unprotected
2. **Tests without assertions** (AP-24) - You THINK you're protected but aren't
3. **Proper tests** - Actual protection

Level 2 is often worse than level 1 because false confidence is more dangerous than acknowledged risk.

**"But it works on my machine" Syndrome:**
Without proper tests:
- Feature works in one scenario: Deployed
- Feature breaks in production: Surprise
- Fix applied: Hope it doesn't break something else
- Repeat forever: Technical debt accumulation

**The Cost Equation:**
```
Time to write test before feature: 10 minutes
Time to debug production issue without tests: 2 hours
Time to write regression test after bug: 15 minutes
Time to rebuild team confidence: Months
```

Tests aren't overhead - they're insurance with positive ROI.
