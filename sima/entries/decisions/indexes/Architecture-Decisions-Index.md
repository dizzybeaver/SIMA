## üìö INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS

### DEC-01: SUGA Pattern
**File:** `DEC-01.md`  
**Summary:** Three-layer architecture (Gateway ‚Üí Interface ‚Üí Core) mathematically prevents circular imports and creates clear separation of concerns.

**Why Critical:**
- Foundation of entire system architecture
- Prevents circular import deadlocks
- Enables interface modularity
- Referenced by 20+ other files

**Key Benefits:**
- Circular imports mathematically impossible
- Clear import hierarchy
- Interface isolation
- Easy to understand and extend

**Related:**
- ARCH-01: Gateway Trinity Pattern
- GATE-01: Three-File Structure
- RULE-01: Gateway-only imports
- AP-01: Direct imports (prevented)

**Path:** `/sima/entries/decisions/architecture/DEC-01.md`

---

### DEC-02: Gateway Centralization
**File:** `DEC-02.md`  
**Summary:** Single gateway.py serves as sole entry point for all operations, providing unified access and consistent behavior.

**Why High Priority:**
- Single point of control
- Consistent operation access
- Simplified testing
- Clear system boundary

**Key Benefits:**
- O(1) operation lookup
- Unified error handling
- Easy to add logging/metrics
- Natural extension point

**Related:**
- DEC-01: SUGA Pattern (implements)
- DEC-03: Dispatch Dictionary (routing mechanism)
- GATE-01: Three-File Structure
- INT-01 through INT-12: All interfaces

**Path:** `/sima/entries/decisions/architecture/DEC-02.md`

---

### DEC-03: Dispatch Dictionary Pattern
**File:** `DEC-03.md`  
**Summary:** Dictionary-based operation routing replaces if/elif chains, providing O(1) lookup and 90% code reduction.

**Why Critical:**
- 90% code reduction (10,000 lines ‚Üí 1,000 lines)
- O(1) operation lookup (constant time)
- Easy extension (add entry to dict)
- No code modification for new operations

**Key Benefits:**
- Predictable performance
- Clean code
- Easy maintenance
- Prevents routing bugs

**Related:**
- DEC-02: Gateway Centralization (uses dispatch)
- ARCH-03: Dispatch Dictionary Pattern
- GATE-01: Gateway structure

**Path:** `/sima/entries/decisions/architecture/DEC-03.md`

---

### DEC-04: No Threading Locks
**File:** `DEC-04.md`  
**Summary:** Lambda is single-threaded, so threading primitives (locks, semaphores, queues) are unnecessary and harmful.

**Why Critical:**
- Lambda constraint: Single-threaded execution
- YAGNI principle: Don't add what you don't need
- Prevents deadlocks
- Simpler code

**Key Benefits:**
- Zero deadlock risk
- Simpler code (no lock management)
- Better performance (no lock overhead)
- Easier to reason about

**Related:**
- AP-08: Threading primitives (anti-pattern)
- ARCH-01: SUGA Pattern (single-threaded assumption)
- LESS-08: Simplicity scales

**Path:** `/sima/entries/decisions/architecture/DEC-04.md`

---

### DEC-05: Sentinel Sanitization
**File:** `DEC-05.md`  
**Summary:** Router sanitizes sentinel objects (_CacheMiss, _ConfigMissing) before returning to caller, preventing 535ms performance penalty.

**Why High Priority:**
- Prevents sentinel leak (BUG-01)
- 535ms performance improvement
- Clean API boundary
- No internal objects exposed

**Key Benefits:**
- Clean external API
- Performance protection
- Clear boundary
- Prevents confusion

**Related:**
- BUG-01: Sentinel leak (caused 535ms penalty)
- AP-19: Sentinel leaks (anti-pattern)
- GATE-01: Gateway responsibilities
- LESS-01: Gateway pattern lessons
