# DEC-02: Gateway Centralization

## Summary

All cross-interface communication must go through gateway.py as the single entry point, enabling centralized logging, metrics, caching, and consistent behavior across the entire system.

---

## Context

After choosing the SIMA pattern (DEC-01), we needed to decide how strictly to enforce gateway usage. Could interfaces sometimes talk directly? Should gateway be optional for simple cases? The decision was to make gateway mandatory for all cross-interface operations to maximize benefits.

## Content

### The Decision

**What We Chose:**
Gateway.py is the **mandatory** single entry point for all cross-interface operations. No exceptions.

**Implementation:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - All operations through gateway
import gateway

gateway.cache_get("key")
gateway.log_info("message")
gateway.http_post("/api/endpoint", data)
gateway.config_get("param")
gateway.metrics_increment("counter")

# ❌ WRONG - Direct core imports bypass gateway
from cache_core import get_value  # Violates DEC-02
from logging_core import log_info  # Violates DEC-02
```

### Rationale

**Why We Chose This:**

1. **Infrastructure Concerns in One Place**
   - Logging can be added/removed at gateway level
   - Metrics collection centralized (one place to track all operations)
   - Caching strategies unified (consistent TTLs, eviction)
   - Authentication/authorization checkpoints
   - **Result:** No need to modify every interface for infrastructure changes

2. **Consistency**
   - All operations follow same pattern
   - Same error handling approach
   - Same logging format across interfaces
   - Same metric naming conventions
   - **Result:** Predictable behavior, easier debugging

3. **Monitoring**
   - Single place to track all operations (complete visibility)
   - Easy to add performance monitoring (measure every call)
   - Request tracing through gateway (follow execution path)
   - Identify bottlenecks quickly (all traffic visible)
   - **Result:** Complete operational visibility with minimal code

4. **Evolution**
   - Add new cross-cutting concerns without touching interfaces
   - Examples: rate limiting, circuit breakers, request validation
   - Gateway wrapper pattern enables incremental enhancement
   - **Result:** System evolves gracefully over time

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: Optional Gateway (Hybrid Approach)**
- **Description:** Allow direct imports for "simple" cases, gateway for "complex" ones
- **Pros:** 
  - Slightly better performance for simple calls
  - Less verbose code in simple cases
- **Cons:**
  - What defines "simple"? (ambiguous criteria)
  - Inconsistent patterns confuse developers
  - Can't track all operations (some bypass gateway)
  - Refactoring risk (simple becomes complex)
- **Why Rejected:** Consistency more important than minor performance gain

**Alternative 2: Multiple Gateways (Domain-Specific)**
- **Description:** Separate gateways for different domains (data_gateway, io_gateway, etc.)
- **Pros:**
  - Domain separation
  - Smaller gateway files
  - Potential performance isolation
- **Cons:**
  - Multiple import statements
  - Which gateway for which operation? (decision fatigue)
  - Cross-domain operations complicated
  - Loses "single entry point" benefit
- **Why Rejected:** Single gateway provides clear structure

**Alternative 3: Gateway as Optional Helper**
- **Description:** Gateway provides convenience but direct imports allowed
- **Pros:**
  - Maximum flexibility
  - Gradual adoption possible
- **Cons:**
  - Pattern not enforced (relies on discipline)
  - Benefits only partial (some ops miss logging/metrics)
  - Code inconsistency across codebase
  - Hard to add system-wide features
- **Why Rejected:** Mandatory pattern prevents anti-patterns

### Trade-offs

**Accepted:**
- Import gateway in every file (vs importing specific modules)
- Gateway becomes central coordination point (potential bottleneck)
- One more layer in call stack (debugging traces slightly longer)
- Verbosity: `gateway.operation()` vs `operation()`

**Benefits:**
- Complete operational visibility (every call tracked)
- System-wide features added in one place (centralized control)
- Consistent error handling (predictable behavior)
- Easy to add monitoring, caching, rate limiting (extensibility)
- Zero direct imports between interfaces (enforces SIMA)

**Net Assessment:**
The minor verbosity and extra stack frame are negligible compared to benefits. Having complete visibility and centralized control has proven invaluable for debugging, monitoring, and evolution. The pattern enforces itself - any direct import is immediately obvious in code review.

### Impact

**On Architecture:**
- Creates single point of control for all operations
- Enables gateway wrapper pattern (DEC-13 fast path caching)
- Makes system-wide changes localized (add feature to gateway, benefits all)
- Enforces SIMA pattern automatically

**On Development:**
- Clear import rule: "import gateway" only
- Code reviews check: "using gateway?"
- New developers learn one pattern, not many
- Refactoring safer (change interface, gateway handles compatibility)

**On Performance:**
- ~100ns overhead per gateway call (negligible)
- Enables optimizations (fast path caching saves 40%)
- Lazy loading possible (import interfaces when needed)
- Overall: slight overhead enables major optimizations

**On Maintenance:**
- Adding logging to all operations: 5 lines in gateway vs 100+ in interfaces
- Adding metrics: same story
- Debugging: all operations visible in one place
- 6+ months: zero cases of "wish we had direct imports"

### Future Considerations

**When to Revisit:**
- If gateway becomes actual bottleneck (>5% CPU time)
- If overhead becomes measurable in critical path
- If team unanimously finds pattern too restrictive
- If Python introduces better alternatives

**Potential Evolution:**
- Domain-specific gateway instances (if needed)
- Gateway code generation from interface definitions
- Static analysis to enforce pattern automatically
- Performance optimizations (already done: fast path caching)

**Monitoring Needs:**
- Track gateway operation volume (which operations most common?)
- Measure gateway overhead (verify negligibility)
- Monitor for direct import anti-patterns (code review + linting)
