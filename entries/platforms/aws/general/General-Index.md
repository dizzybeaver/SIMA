### AWS-LESS-01: Three Data Processing Patterns

**File:** `AWS-General-ProcessingPatterns_AWS-LESS-01.md`  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ  High  
**Status:** Active

**Summary:** Serverless workloads fall into three patterns: synchronous (request-response), asynchronous (queued), and streaming (continuous). Each has distinct latency, scaling, and error handling characteristics. Choose based on user expectations, not technical convenience.

**The Three Patterns:**

**Synchronous:**
- User waits for response
- < 1 second required
- Simple error handling
- Use: API queries, form submissions

**Asynchronous:**
- Fire-and-forget with status tracking
- Seconds-minutes acceptable
- Complex error handling (retries, DLQ)
- Use: Image processing, batch jobs

**Streaming:**
- Continuous data flow
- < 100ms near real-time
- Very complex error handling
- Use: IoT sensors, log aggregation

**Decision Tree:**
```
User expects immediate result? â†’ Synchronous
Operation < 1 second? â†’ Synchronous
Continuous data flow? â†’ Streaming
Otherwise â†’ Asynchronous
```
