# CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUGA-ISP DEVELOPMENT

Version: 2.0.0  
Date: 2025-10-21  
Purpose: Complete instructions for Claude when working on SUGA-ISP Lambda project

---

## ‚ö° MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - EVERY SESSION

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING else in a new session:**

1. Search project knowledge for: **"SESSION-START-Quick-Context"**
2. Read the COMPLETE file (takes 30-45 seconds)
3. Load the critical architecture into working memory:
   - SIMA pattern (Gateway ‚Üí Interface ‚Üí Implementation)
   - Import rules (gateway only, never core)
   - 12 interfaces (CACHE, LOGGING, SECURITY, etc.)
   - Top 10 instant answers
   - Query routing patterns
   - RED FLAGS to never suggest
   - Top 20 REF-IDs

4. THEN proceed with user's question

### Why This Matters

- Loads critical context ONCE per session
- Saves 4-6 minutes on subsequent queries
- Provides instant answers to top 10 questions
- Prevents common mistakes (RED FLAGS)
- Makes neural map searches faster (routing patterns)

### If This Is a Continuing Session

- You can skip re-reading if you've already read it this session
- But mentally verify: Do I remember SIMA pattern, import rules, RED FLAGS?
- If uncertain, skim the instant answers section

---

## üîÑ SESSION FLOW (Enhanced Workflow)

```
Session Start
    ‚Üì
Read SESSION-START-Quick-Context.md (30-45 sec, ONE TIME)
    ‚Üì
Context loaded ‚úÖ (includes Top 20 REF-IDs, workflows, RED FLAGS)
    ‚Üì
User asks question
    ‚Üì
Check instant answers first (in context file)
    ‚Üì
If instant answer exists ‚Üí Respond immediately (5 sec)
    ‚Üì
If workflow pattern recognized ‚Üí Check Workflows-Playbook (10 sec)
    ‚Üì
If not instant ‚Üí Use routing patterns to find right file
    ‚Üì
Search specific neural map file (10 sec)
    ‚Üì
If REF-ID cross-reference needed ‚Üí Check REF-ID-Directory (5 sec)
    ‚Üì
Before suggesting solution ‚Üí Quick scan Anti-Patterns-Checklist (5 sec)
    ‚Üì
Read COMPLETE section (15-20 sec)
    ‚Üì
Respond with full context + REF-ID citation
```

**Time savings:**
- Old way: 30-60 sec per query (search from scratch each time)
- New way: 5-15 sec per query (context + tools pre-loaded)
- Net savings: ~4-6 minutes per session with 10 queries

- Benefit: Prevents mistakes, no back-and-forth corrections

üí° **Pro tip:** If you encounter a REF-ID, workflow pattern, or need to verify an anti-pattern, these files provide instant answers without broad searching.

---

## üö® CRITICAL: Before Responding to ANY Question

**ALWAYS do these 3 things FIRST:**

### 1. Search Neural Maps (Project Knowledge)

**MANDATORY:** Search project knowledge for EVERY question about:
- Architecture, design decisions, or "why" questions
- How to implement features or modify code
- Import rules, dependencies, or structure
- Bugs, errors, or troubleshooting
- Best practices or lessons learned
- Performance, optimization, or cold start
- ANY aspect of the SUGA-ISP Lambda project

**Never skip this step.** The neural maps are the authoritative source of truth.

### 2. Read COMPLETE Sections (Don't Skim!)

When you find relevant content:
- ‚úÖ Read the ENTIRE section thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Read related sections if cross-referenced
- ‚úÖ Understand the full context before answering
- ‚ùå Never skim or provide answers from partial information
- ‚ùå Never assume you remember from previous sessions

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Did I read the complete section, not just the title?
- Did I follow cross-references to related REF-IDs?
- Do I understand the full context and rationale?
- Am I citing specific REF-IDs from the neural maps?

### 3. Cite Sources (Always Use REF-IDs)

Every response should include:
- Specific REF-ID citations (e.g., DEC-04, RULE-01, BUG-01)
- File locations when relevant
- Cross-references to related decisions or lessons

**Example:**
```
According to DEC-04 (NM04-TECHNICAL-Decisions.md), Lambda is single-threaded,
so threading locks are unnecessary. This decision was informed by LESS-06
and prevents the issues seen in BUG-03.
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE TERMINOLOGY

### Important Distinction

**SIMA** = Architectural pattern (Gateway ‚Üí Interface ‚Üí Implementation)
- This is the design pattern used throughout the project
- Three-layer structure: Gateway layer ‚Üí Interface layer ‚Üí Implementation layer
- Prevents circular imports and provides clean separation of concerns

**SUGA-ISP** = Lambda project name that uses SIMA architecture
- SUGA = Single Universal Gateway Architecture
- ISP = Interface Segregation Principle
- This is the name of the specific Lambda project

**Neural Maps** = Also use SIMA structure
- Index files (Gateway layer)
- Interface/Category files (Interface layer)
- Implementation files (Implementation layer)

### Usage Examples

**‚úÖ Correct:**
- "The SIMA architecture uses a three-layer pattern..."
- "SIMA pattern prevents circular imports..."
- "The SUGA-ISP project implements SIMA architecture..."
- "In SUGA-ISP, gateway.py is the gateway layer..."
- "According to the SIMA pattern, always import via gateway..."

**‚ùå Incorrect:**
- "SUGA-ISP architecture" ‚Üí Use "SIMA architecture"
- "SUGA pattern" ‚Üí Use "SIMA pattern"
- "The SUGA prevents imports" ‚Üí Use "The SIMA pattern prevents..."

## üéØ PROJECT RULES (The 4 Golden Rules)

### RULE 1: Search Neural Maps FIRST
- Neural maps are THE authoritative source of truth
- Search before answering any question about architecture, design, or implementation
- Never rely on memory or assumptions - always verify

### RULE 2: Read COMPLETE Sections
- Read entire sections, not just titles or summaries
- Follow cross-references to related content
- Understand full context before responding
- Never skim or provide partial information

### RULE 3: Always Cite Sources
- Every answer should reference specific REF-IDs
- Include file locations when relevant
- Build user's understanding of the neural map structure
- Make responses verifiable and traceable

### RULE 4: Verify Before Suggesting
- Check Anti-Patterns-Checklist before every solution
- Ensure solution follows SIMA pattern
- Confirm no design decision violations
- Use 5-step verification protocol (LESS-15)

---

## üö´ RED FLAGS (Never Suggest These)

**These should trigger immediate rejection:**

### Critical (Never Do)
1. **Threading locks** - Lambda is single-threaded (DEC-04)
2. **Direct core imports** - Always use gateway (RULE-01)
3. **Bare except clauses** - Use specific exceptions (AP-14)
4. **Sentinel objects crossing boundaries** - Sanitize at router (DEC-05)
5. **Heavy libraries without justification** - 128MB limit (DEC-07)
6. **Subdirectories** - Keep flat structure except home_assistant/ (DEC-08)
7. **Skipping verification protocol** - Always use 5-step checklist (LESS-15)
8. **Modifying without reading complete file** - Read entire file first (LESS-01)

### When User Asks
- "Can I use threading locks?" ‚Üí **NO** (AP-08, DEC-04)
- "Can I import cache_core directly?" ‚Üí **NO** (AP-01, RULE-01)
- "Can I use bare except?" ‚Üí **NO** (AP-14, ERR-02)
- "Can I add subdirectories?" ‚Üí **NO** (AP-05, DEC-08)
- "Can I skip verification?" ‚Üí **NO** (AP-27, LESS-15)

## üìñ NEURAL MAP STRUCTURE

### File Organization

**Gateway Layer (2 files):**
- `NEURAL_MAP_00-Quick_Index.md` - Fast lookup index
- `NEURAL_MAP_00A-Master_Index.md` - Complete system map

**Interface Layer (7 INDEX files):**
- `NM01-INDEX-Architecture.md` - Architecture & 12 interfaces
- `NM02-INDEX-Dependencies.md` - Imports & dependency layers
- `NM03-INDEX-Operations.md` - Operation flows & pathways
- `NM04-INDEX-Decisions.md` - Design decisions & rationale
- `NM05-INDEX-Anti-Patterns.md` - What NOT to do
- `NM06-INDEX-Learned.md` - Bugs, lessons, wisdom
- `NM07-INDEX-DecisionLogic.md` - Decision trees & logic

**Implementation Layer (~23 files):**
- CORE files - Core concepts & architecture
- CATEGORY files - Organized by topic (INTERFACES, RULES, etc.)
- Detailed implementation files for each neural map

### Search Patterns

**Pattern ‚Üí File Mapping:**
- "why no [X]" ‚Üí NM04-Design-Decisions
- "how to import [X]" ‚Üí NM02-Dependencies + NM07-Decision-Trees
- "can I [X]" ‚Üí NM05-Anti-Patterns (check if prohibited)
- "what happened with [bug]" ‚Üí NM06-Bugs
- "how does [operation] work" ‚Üí NM03-Operations
- "what interfaces exist" ‚Üí NM01-Architecture

**Keyword ‚Üí File Mapping:**
- threading ‚Üí NM04-TECHNICAL-Decisions.md (DEC-04)
- sentinel ‚Üí NM06-BUGS-Critical.md (BUG-01)
- import, circular ‚Üí NM02-RULES-Import.md (RULE-01)
- cache ‚Üí NM01-INTERFACES-Core.md (INT-01)
- cold start ‚Üí NM03-CORE-Pathways.md (PATH-01)

## üéØ SIMA ARCHITECTURE QUICK REFERENCE

### The Pattern
```
Gateway Layer (gateway.py)
    ‚Üì
Interface Layer (standardized APIs)
    ‚Üì
Implementation Layer (core files)
```

### 12 Core Interfaces
1. **INT-01: CACHE** - Cache operations
2. **INT-02: LOGGING** - Logging operations  
3. **INT-03: SECURITY** - Security operations
4. **INT-04: METRICS** - Metrics operations
5. **INT-05: CONFIG** - Configuration operations
6. **INT-06: VALIDATION** - Validation operations
7. **INT-07: PERSISTENCE** - Data persistence operations
8. **INT-08: COMMUNICATION** - External communication
9. **INT-09: TRANSFORMATION** - Data transformation
10. **INT-10: SCHEDULING** - Task scheduling
11. **INT-11: MONITORING** - Health monitoring
12. **INT-12: ERROR_HANDLING** - Error management

### Import Rules
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always import gateway
import gateway
value = gateway.cache_get(key)
gateway.log_info("message")

# ‚ùå WRONG - Never import core directly
from cache_core import get_value  # Violates RULE-01
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Single Entry Point** (DEC-01) - All operations through gateway
2. **No Threading Locks** (DEC-04) - Lambda is single-threaded
3. **Flat File Structure** (DEC-08) - No subdirectories except home_assistant/
4. **Lazy Loading** (LMMS) - Defer heavy imports for cold start
5. **Sentinel Sanitization** (DEC-05) - Sanitize at router layer

## üîß GITHUB ACCESS NOTES

**You do NOT have direct GitHub access.** If you need to see GitHub files:

1. Ask user to show you the file content
2. Or ask user to copy/paste the relevant code
3. Never assume you can read from GitHub directly

This is important because you cannot verify code without seeing it.

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (LESS-15)

**Before suggesting ANY code change, complete this 5-step checklist:**

1. **Read Complete File**
   - [ ] Read entire current file, not just the section to modify
   - [ ] Understand full context and dependencies

2. **Verify SIMA Pattern**
   - [ ] Gateway function exists/updated
   - [ ] Interface definition follows pattern
   - [ ] Implementation in correct core file

3. **Check Anti-Patterns**
   - [ ] Scanned Anti-Patterns-Checklist
   - [ ] No direct imports (AP-01)
   - [ ] No threading locks (AP-08)
   - [ ] No bare excepts (AP-14)
   - [ ] No sentinel leaks (AP-19)

4. **Verify Dependencies**
   - [ ] No circular imports
   - [ ] Follows dependency layers (DEP-01 to DEP-08)
   - [ ] Total size < 128MB if adding library

5. **Cite Sources**
   - [ ] Referenced relevant REF-IDs
   - [ ] Included file locations
   - [ ] Explained rationale with citations

**Never skip this protocol.** It prevents 90% of common mistakes.

## üéì COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Skimming Instead of Reading
**Problem:** Providing answers based on partial information  
**Solution:** Always read complete sections, follow cross-references

### Mistake 2: Assuming from Memory
**Problem:** Relying on previous session knowledge  
**Solution:** Always search and verify in neural maps

### Mistake 3: Missing Anti-Pattern Checks
**Problem:** Suggesting solutions that violate anti-patterns  
**Solution:** Scan Anti-Patterns-Checklist before every response

### Mistake 4: Not Following Workflows
**Problem:** Reinventing decision trees each time  
**Solution:** Use Workflows-Playbook for common scenarios

### Mistake 5: Poor Citations
**Problem:** Vague references without REF-IDs  
**Solution:** Always cite specific REF-IDs with file locations

### Mistake 6: Skipping Verification
**Problem:** Suggesting unverified changes  
**Solution:** Complete LESS-15 checklist for all code changes
