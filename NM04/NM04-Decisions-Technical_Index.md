## Topic Overview

**Description:** Technical implementation decisions that optimize performance, robustness, and maintainability of the Lambda Execution Engine. These decisions focus on HOW features are implemented rather than the overall architecture. Includes configuration strategies, performance optimizations, error handling, and documentation approaches.

**Keywords:** implementation, optimization, configuration, performance, error handling, testing, documentation, lazy loading, caching

## Individual Files

### DEC-12: Multi-Tier Configuration
- **File:** `NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-12.md`
- **Summary:** Four configuration tiers (minimum, standard, maximum, user) for flexible deployment options
- **Priority:** 游릭 Medium
- **Impact:** Deployment flexibility, resource optimization, sensible defaults
- **Key Benefit:** Right-size resources for different environments

### DEC-13: Fast Path Caching
- **File:** `NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-13.md`
- **Summary:** Cache frequently-called operation routes to bypass lookups for hot paths
- **Priority:** 游릭 Medium
- **Impact:** 40% performance gain for hot operations, transparent to users
- **Key Benefit:** Automatic optimization after 10 calls

### DEC-14: Lazy Loading Interfaces
- **File:** `NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-14.md`
- **Summary:** Import interface routers only when first operation called
- **Priority:** 游리 High
- **Impact:** ~60ms average cold start savings, lower memory footprint
- **Key Benefit:** Pay-per-use model, only load what's needed

### DEC-15: Router-Level Exception Catching
- **File:** `NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-15.md`
- **Summary:** Interface routers catch exceptions and log before re-raising
- **Priority:** 游리 High
- **Impact:** Guaranteed error logging, structured error responses
- **Key Benefit:** Never lose error information

### DEC-16: Import Error Protection
- **File:** `NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-16.md`
- **Summary:** Wrap interface imports in try/except for graceful degradation
- **Priority:** 游리 High
- **Impact:** Robustness, partial functionality on failure, clear error messages
- **Key Benefit:** Lambda still works if non-critical interface fails

### DEC-17: Home Assistant as Mini-ISP
- **File:** `NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-17.md`
- **Summary:** Home Assistant extension follows ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) internally
- **Priority:** 游릭 Medium
- **Impact:** Extension architecture pattern, clean internal structure
- **Key Benefit:** Extensions can use same patterns as main system

### DEC-18: Interface-Level Mocking
- **File:** `NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-18.md`
- **Summary:** Mock at interface router level for unit tests, not individual functions
- **Priority:** 游릭 Medium
- **Impact:** Faster tests (3x), easier test setup, realistic behavior
- **Key Benefit:** Test entire interface behavior, not implementation details

### DEC-19: Neural Map Documentation
- **File:** `NM04-Decisions-Technical_DEC-19.md`
- **Summary:** Use neural maps as synthetic memory system to preserve design knowledge
- **Priority:** 游댮 Critical
- **Impact:** Knowledge preservation, context for Claude, team understanding
- **Key Benefit:** Decisions documented with rationale, alternatives, trade-offs
