- **Yes** → Consider LMMS
- **No** → SUGA + DD sufficient (optionally add ZAPH for performance)

### Question 2: Is cold start time critical?
- **Yes** → Use LMMS with LIGS
- **No** → SUGA + DD sufficient

### Question 3: Is memory constrained (< 512MB)?
- **Yes** → Use LMMS with LUGS
- **No** → SUGA + DD sufficient

### Question 4: Is sub-100ms latency required?
- **Yes** → Add ZAPH (standalone or as part of LMMS)

## 📚 IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

### Phase 1: Foundation (Required)
1. Implement **ARCH-SUGA** (gateway structure)
2. Implement **ARCH-DD** (interface routing)

**Result:** Working system with clean architecture

---

### Phase 2: Measurement (Recommended)
1. Profile system to identify bottlenecks
2. Measure cold start time (if serverless)
3. Measure memory usage
4. Identify hot operations

**Result:** Data to guide optimization

---

### Phase 3: Serverless Optimization (If Applicable)
1. Implement **ARCH-LMMS** LIGS (lazy loading)
2. Measure improvement
3. Implement **ARCH-LMMS** LUGS (if memory constrained)
4. Measure improvement

**Result:** Optimized cold start and memory

---

### Phase 4: Hot Path Optimization (If Needed)
1. Profile to confirm hot operations
2. Implement **ARCH-ZAPH** for top 3-5 operations
3. Measure improvement
4. Expand to Tier 2 if beneficial

**Result:** Optimized hot path latency

---

## ⚠️ ANTI-PATTERNS

### Anti-Pattern 1: ZAPH Without Profiling
**Problem:** Adding hot paths based on guesses  
**Solution:** Always profile before implementing ZAPH

### Anti-Pattern 2: LMMS in Non-Serverless
**Problem:** Using LIGS/LUGS in long-running servers  
**Solution:** LMMS is for serverless; use standard imports for servers

### Anti-Pattern 3: Skipping DD in SUGA
**Problem:** Using if/elif routing in SUGA interfaces  
**Solution:** Always use DD pattern for consistency

### Anti-Pattern 4: ZAPH Without Fallback
**Problem:** Only implementing hot path, breaking cold operations  
**Solution:** Always maintain normal path as fallback
