## Summary

Import interface routers only when first operation called, saving ~60ms average cold start time and reducing memory footprint.

---

## Context

During cold start optimization efforts, profiling revealed that importing all 12 interface routers upfront consumed ~120ms of initialization time. However, typical Lambda invocations only use 5-6 interfaces on average. This meant we were paying a ~50% overhead penalty for interfaces that would never be called during that execution.

The Lambda Execution Engine needed a way to defer interface loading until actually needed, while maintaining the clean SIMA architecture pattern.

### The Decision

**What We Chose:**
Implement lazy loading pattern for interface routers using Python's `importlib` module. Interfaces are imported on first use rather than at module initialization.

**Implementation:**
```python
_loaded_interfaces = {}

def get_interface(name):
    if name not in _loaded_interfaces:
        _loaded_interfaces[name] = importlib.import_module(f"interface_{name}")
    return _loaded_interfaces[name]
```

### Rationale

**Why We Chose This:**

1. **Significant Cold Start Improvement:**
   - Upfront loading: 120ms for all 12 interfaces
   - Lazy loading: ~60ms for typical 6 interfaces used
   - Average savings: 60ms per cold start (50% reduction)
   - Critical for Lambda where cold start time directly impacts user experience

2. **Memory Efficiency:**
   - Only load modules that will actually be used
   - Reduces memory footprint for simple operations
   - Allows Lambda to run in smaller memory configurations
   - Memory savings compound with rarely-used interfaces

3. **Maintains Architecture Integrity:**
   - Still respects SIMA pattern (gateway → interface → implementation)
   - No changes to calling code
   - Clean separation of concerns preserved
   - Easy to add new interfaces without impacting startup

4. **Pay-for-What-You-Use Model:**
   - Aligns with Lambda's execution-based pricing
   - Diagnostic calls don't pay for Home Assistant loading
   - Simple cache operations don't load HTTP client
   - Cost optimization through selective loading

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: Eager Loading (Original Approach)**
- **Description:** Import all interfaces at module initialization
- **Pros:** 
  - Simpler code (no lazy loading logic)
  - All interfaces available immediately
  - Predictable performance (no first-call penalty)
- **Cons:**
  - 120ms cold start overhead
  - Wastes memory on unused interfaces
  - Scales poorly as more interfaces added
- **Why Rejected:** 50% overhead penalty unacceptable for cold start optimization

**Alternative 2: Manual Conditional Imports**
- **Description:** Import interfaces inline where needed throughout codebase
- **Pros:**
  - Minimal startup overhead
  - Maximum flexibility
- **Cons:**
  - Violates SIMA pattern (imports scattered throughout code)
  - Difficult to maintain
  - Risk of circular imports
  - Loses centralized gateway control
- **Why Rejected:** Breaks fundamental architecture principle (RULE-01)

**Alternative 3: Preload Common Interfaces Only**
- **Description:** Load CACHE, LOGGING upfront; lazy load others
- **Pros:**
  - Balances startup time with convenience
  - Common operations have no first-call penalty
- **Cons:**
  - Arbitrary decisions about what's "common"
  - Still pays penalty for unused "common" interfaces
  - More complex code (two loading paths)
- **Why Rejected:** Lazy loading is simple and works for all interfaces uniformly

### Trade-offs

**Accepted:**
- **First-call penalty:** First use of an interface adds ~10ms latency
  - Acceptable because it's one-time per execution
  - Still faster than eager loading all interfaces
  - Amortized across multiple calls to same interface

- **Slightly more complex gateway code:** Need to manage loaded_interfaces dict
  - Minimal complexity (5 lines of code)
  - Well-contained in gateway module
  - Easy to understand and maintain

**Benefits:**
- **60ms cold start savings:** Average 50% reduction in interface loading time
- **Memory efficiency:** Only load what's needed
- **Scalability:** Can add more interfaces without impacting startup
- **Cost optimization:** Pay only for interfaces actually used

**Net Assessment:**
Strongly positive. The 10ms first-call penalty is vastly outweighed by the 60ms cold start savings, especially considering most Lambda executions reuse warm containers where interfaces remain loaded. This is a clear win for performance, cost, and scalability.

### Impact

**On Architecture:**
- Reinforces SIMA pattern's benefits (centralized loading)
- Enables interface proliferation without startup penalty
- Sets pattern for future lazy-loading optimizations

**On Development:**
- No changes to interface calling code
- New interfaces automatically benefit from lazy loading
- Testing unchanged (interfaces still load when called)

**On Performance:**
- **Cold start:** 60ms faster (50% improvement)
- **Warm execution:** No impact (interfaces cached after first use)
- **Memory:** Reduced footprint for simple operations
- **First call:** +10ms one-time penalty per interface

**On Maintenance:**
- Simple pattern, easy to understand
- No ongoing maintenance burden
- Can monitor loading patterns via metrics
- Easy to disable if needed (switch to eager loading)

### Future Considerations

**When to Revisit:**
- If cold start time becomes less critical (unlikely)
- If first-call penalty becomes problematic (monitor metrics)
- If interface count grows significantly (consider tiered loading)

**Potential Evolution:**
- **Smart preloading:** Load likely-needed interfaces based on request pattern
- **Progressive loading:** Load interfaces in background during execution
- **Usage analytics:** Track which interfaces are actually used, optimize further

**Monitoring:**
- Track first-call latency per interface
- Monitor cold start time improvements
- Measure memory usage patterns
- Analyze which interfaces are never loaded
