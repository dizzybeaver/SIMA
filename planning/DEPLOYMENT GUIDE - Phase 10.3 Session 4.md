## 📋 PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

**Before deploying, verify:**

- [ ] Both directories exist or can be created
- [ ] Current working directory is correct
- [ ] Permissions allow file creation
- [ ] No filename conflicts with existing files
- [ ] Backup of any existing files if overwriting

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Create Directories (if needed)

```bash
# From /sima/entries/lessons/ directory
mkdir -p optimization
mkdir -p learning
```

### Step 2: Deploy Optimization Files

**Copy all 12 optimization files from artifacts to:**
```
/sima/entries/lessons/optimization/
```

**Files to deploy:**
1. LESS-25.md
2. LESS-26.md
3. LESS-28.md
4. LESS-29.md
5. LESS-35.md
6. LESS-37.md
7. LESS-40.md
8. LESS-49.md
9. LESS-50.md
10. LESS-51.md
11. LESS-52.md
12. Optimization-Index.md

### Step 3: Deploy Learning Files

**Copy all 5 learning files from artifacts to:**
```
/sima/entries/lessons/learning/
```

**Files to deploy:**
1. LESS-43.md
2. LESS-44.md
3. LESS-45.md
4. LESS-47.md
5. Learning-Index.md

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check optimization directory
ls -la /sima/entries/lessons/optimization/
# Should show 12 files

# Check learning directory  
ls -la /sima/entries/lessons/learning/
# Should show 5 files

# Verify file contents
head -20 /sima/entries/lessons/optimization/LESS-25.md
head -20 /sima/entries/lessons/learning/LESS-43.md
```

- 12 optimization files in correct directory
- 5 learning files in correct directory

✅ **All files readable:**
- No permission errors
- No encoding issues
- Headers display correctly

✅ **Directory structure correct:**
- `/sima/entries/lessons/optimization/` exists with 12 files
- `/sima/entries/lessons/learning/` exists with 5 files

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Directory doesn't exist
**Solution:** Create with `mkdir -p /sima/entries/lessons/optimization` and `mkdir -p /sima/entries/lessons/learning`

### Issue: Permission denied
**Solution:** Check permissions with `ls -la` and adjust with `chmod` if needed

### Issue: File already exists
**Solution:** Backup existing file, then overwrite with new version

### Issue: Cross-reference broken
**Solution:** Verify all referenced files exist in their expected locations

### Issue: Line count > 400
**Solution:** All files verified under 400 lines - should not occur
