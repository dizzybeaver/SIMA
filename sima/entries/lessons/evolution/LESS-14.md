## Title

Evolution is Normal

---

## Priority

HIGH

---

## Summary

Architecture improves through iteration based on real experience. Each problem drives the next improvement. Codebases naturally evolve - plan for change rather than trying to prevent it.

---

## Context

Realized that architecture has continuously improved through iteration: Direct imports → Gateway pattern → Data sanitization → Standard dispatch → Documentation. Each problem led to targeted improvement.

---

## Lesson

### The Pattern

**Architecture is never "done":**
```
Design → Implement → Learn → Improve → Document → Repeat
```

Not: "Design perfect architecture upfront" → Implement → Done

### Evolution Examples

**Import Strategy Evolution:**
```
v1.0: Direct imports
Problem: Circular dependencies

v2.0: Gateway pattern
Problem: Data leaking

v3.0: Router sanitization
Problem: Inconsistent patterns

v4.0: Standard dispatch everywhere
Current: Working well, documented
```

**Configuration Evolution:**
```
v1.0: All environment variables
Problem: Secrets visible

v2.0: All secure storage
Problem: Too many parameters, hard to deploy

v3.0: Secrets in secure storage, rest in env
Problem: Unclear which goes where

v4.0: Token-only in secure storage
Current: Simple, clear, working
```

### Key Insight

**Problems are learning opportunities:**
```
❌ Bad: "We designed wrong, start over"
✅ Good: "We learned something, let's improve"
```

Each bug discovered:
- Revealed architecture weakness
- Led to targeted improvement
- Made system more robust
- Got documented

### Documentation of Evolution

**Track evolution:**
```
Decision doc: Gateway pattern (why)
    ↓
Bug report: Circular import (what it solved)
    ↓
Lesson learned: Gateway prevents problems (wisdom)
```

### Continuous Improvement Mindset

**Embrace iteration:**
```python
# Version 1.0 (working but not optimal)
def cache_get(key):
    return _store.get(key)

# Version 2.0 (improved based on bug)
def cache_get(key):
    result = _store.get(key, _SENTINEL)
    return None if result is _SENTINEL else result

# Version 3.0 (sanitization at router)
# Router handles sentinel, core stays pure
```

Each version better than last - not because v1.0 was "wrong", but because we learned and improved.

### When to Evolve vs Rewrite

**Evolve (preferred - 95%):**
- Architecture fundamentally sound
- Problems are edge cases
- Can improve incrementally
- Knowledge preserved

**Rewrite (rare - 5%):**
- Architecture fundamentally flawed
- Band-aids on band-aids
- Can't improve incrementally
- Fresh start needed

### Key Principles

**1. Architecture Evolves Based on Experience**
```
Theory → Practice → Learn → Improve
Not: Theory → Perfect Implementation
```

**2. Document the Journey**
- What we tried
- What we learned
- Why we changed
- What we kept

**3. Each Bug Teaches**
```
Bug → Analyze → Improve → Document
```

**4. Stability Through Evolution**
- Paradox: System most stable when evolving
- Why: Continuous learning and improvement
