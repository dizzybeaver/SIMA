## Bug Catalog

### BUG-01: Sentinel Leak (Performance)
**File:** `BUG-01.md`  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Impact:** 535ms cold start penalty â†’ Fixed (62% improvement)  
**Summary:** Sentinel object leaked to router causing performance degradation  
**Solution:** Added sanitization at router boundary  
**Key Lesson:** Infrastructure concerns belong in router layer

---

### BUG-02: Circular Import (Architecture)
**File:** `BUG-02.md`  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Impact:** Import failures, system instability â†’ Fixed with SUGA pattern  
**Summary:** Direct imports between modules created circular dependencies  
**Solution:** Implemented gateway pattern  
**Key Lesson:** Architecture prevents problems better than rules

---

### BUG-03: Cascading Failures (Reliability)
**File:** `BUG-03.md`  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Impact:** Complete outage from single component failure â†’ Fixed with error boundaries  
**Summary:** Cache failure caused entire Lambda to fail  
**Solution:** Multi-layer error boundaries and graceful degradation  
**Key Lesson:** Design for failure, not just success

---

### BUG-04: Configuration Mismatch (Deployment)
**File:** `BUG-04.md`  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Impact:** Deployment failures, production errors â†’ Fixed with simplified config  
**Summary:** Mixed configuration sources caused deployment inconsistencies  
**Solution:** SSM token-only approach  
**Key Lesson:** Single source of truth for configuration

## Common Themes

### Theme 1: Architecture Prevents Problems
- **BUG-01:** Router sanitization prevents sentinel leaks
- **BUG-02:** Gateway pattern prevents circular imports
- **BUG-03:** Error boundaries prevent cascading failures
- **Pattern:** Good architecture makes bugs impossible

### Theme 2: Isolation is Critical
- **BUG-03:** Error boundaries prevent cascading failures
- **BUG-04:** Configuration isolation prevents deployment errors
- **Pattern:** Defense in depth protects system

### Theme 3: Simplicity Wins
- **BUG-04:** Simplified configuration prevents deployment errors
- **BUG-02:** Simple gateway pattern prevents complex import issues
- **Pattern:** Complexity is the enemy of reliability

### Theme 4: Measure and Monitor
- **All bugs discovered through:** timing logs, import tracing, error logs, deployment verification
- **Pattern:** You can't fix what you don't measure

## Prevention Checklist

Based on bug experiences:

1. **Always sanitize at router layer** (BUG-01)
2. **Use gateway pattern for all cross-interface operations** (BUG-02)
3. **Implement error boundaries at multiple layers** (BUG-03)
4. **Simplify configuration to single source of truth** (BUG-04)
5. **Measure performance to detect anomalies early** (BUG-01)
6. **Test failure paths, not just happy paths** (BUG-03)
7. **Validate configuration at startup** (BUG-04)
8. **Use verification checklist before deployment** (All)

**Architecture:**
- ARCH-01: SUGA Pattern (solution to BUG-02)

**Decisions:**
- DEC-01: SUGA pattern choice (from BUG-02)
- DEC-05: Sentinel sanitization (from BUG-01)
- DEC-15: Graceful degradation (from BUG-03)
- DEC-21: SSM token-only config (from BUG-04)

**Lessons:**
- LESS-01: Gateway prevents problems
- LESS-02: Measure don't guess
- LESS-05: Graceful degradation
- LESS-06: Pay small costs early
- LESS-09: Partial deployment danger
- LESS-15: File verification mandatory

**Anti-Patterns:**
- AP-01: Direct cross-interface imports (caused BUG-02)
- AP-14: Bare except clauses (related to BUG-03)
- AP-19: Sentinel objects crossing boundaries (caused BUG-01)

**Wisdom:**
- WISD-01: Architecture prevents problems
- WISD-02: Measure don't guess
- WISD-03: Small costs early prevent large costs later
