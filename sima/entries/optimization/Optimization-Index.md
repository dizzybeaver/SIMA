## Individual Files

### LESS-25: Compliant Code Accelerates Optimization
- **File:** `LESS-25.md`
- **Summary:** Compliant code reduces optimization by 50%; additive faster than corrective
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 2-3x cost to fix later vs start right

### LESS-26: Session Size Based on Complexity
- **File:** `LESS-26.md`
- **Summary:** Session size scales with complexity (1-4 components per session)
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 4x variance in throughput based on complexity

### LESS-28: Pattern Mastery Accelerates Development
- **File:** `LESS-28.md`
- **Summary:** 8-10 repetitions transition patterns to muscle memory, 2.5-4× faster
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 2.5-4× acceleration after mastery

### LESS-29: Zero Tolerance for Anti-Patterns
- **File:** `LESS-29.md`
- **Summary:** Systematic verification eliminates violations at 68-120× ROI
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 0 violations across 66 artifacts at high velocity

### LESS-35: Throughput Scales with Complexity Understanding
- **File:** `LESS-35.md`
- **Summary:** 4 simple components complete in time of 2 complex ones
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 5× throughput variance by complexity

### LESS-37: Pattern Implementation Becomes Muscle Memory
- **File:** `LESS-37.md`
- **Summary:** After ~10 applications, implementation drops from 20min to <5min
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Key Metric:** 79% faster after muscle memory

### LESS-40: Velocity and Quality Both Improve with Mastery
- **File:** `LESS-40.md`
- **Summary:** Speed and quality not in conflict—both increase with patterns
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 4× speed + 100% quality maintained

### LESS-49: Reference Implementation Accelerates Replication
- **File:** `LESS-49.md`
- **Summary:** First implementation as template reduces subsequent work 65-70%
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 88% ROI on reference creation

### LESS-50: Interface Starting Points Vary Dramatically
- **File:** `LESS-50.md`
- **Summary:** 5min assessment reveals 60-90% time savings opportunity
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 85% variance in starting points

### LESS-51: Phase 2 Often Unnecessary If Already Optimized
- **File:** `LESS-51.md`
- **Summary:** Data-driven phase decisions save 15-20h per component
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 112-150× ROI on assessment

### LESS-52: Artifact Template Creation Accelerates Future Work
- **File:** `LESS-52.md`
- **Summary:** 33% overhead on first creates 68% savings on subsequent
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Key Metric:** 244-375% ROI on templates
