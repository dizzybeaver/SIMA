| "SUGA-ISP Lambda project" | ✅ Correct usage throughout | ✅ PASS |
| "SUGA-ISP architecture" | ❌ Not used (correct) | ✅ PASS |

**Terminology section present:** ✅ In all 4 files

---

## Known Issues

**None identified.** All routing works as expected.

---

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Keep file structure** - 4-file split works well
2. ✅ **Maintain line limits** - All files well under 600 lines
3. ✅ **Update Master Index** - Document shows what to update
4. ✅ **Monitor references** - Track most-referenced sections
5. ✅ **Extend pattern to other NMs** - Apply same split pattern

---

## Conclusion

**NM01 Split Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**

**Summary:**
- ✅ All 18 REF IDs (6 ARCH + 12 INT) documented and accessible
- ✅ Routing through INDEX works correctly
- ✅ All files under size limits
- ✅ No truncation issues
- ✅ Integration with other NMs verified
- ✅ Terminology consistent and correct

**Ready for:** Production use by Claude in all sessions

**Next Steps:**
- Apply same pattern to other large neural maps
- Continue with NM02, NM03, NM04, NM05, NM07 assessment
