## Individual Files

### LESS-14: Evolution is Normal
- **File:** `LESS-14.md`
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Summary:** Architecture improves through iteration based on real experience
- **Related:** LESS-11, LESS-16, DEC-01

### LESS-16: Adaptation Over Rewriting
- **File:** `LESS-16.md`
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Summary:** Adapt internals while preserving API surface to save 80% of time
- **Related:** LESS-09, LESS-14, BUG-04

### LESS-18: Singleton Pattern Lifecycle Management
- **File:** `LESS-18.md`
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Summary:** Singleton pattern enables proper initialization, access, and cleanup
- **Related:** LESS-14, LESS-08

## Cross-Topic Relationships

**Related Topics:**
- Core Architecture (foundation for evolution)
- Documentation (captures evolution history)
- Operations (deployment of evolved system)

**Frequently Accessed Together:**
- When refactoring: LESS-14, LESS-16
- When simplifying: LESS-16 (adapt, don't rewrite)
- When improving: LESS-14 (embrace iteration)

## Usage Patterns

**When evolving system:**
1. Follow LESS-14 (evolution is normal)
2. Apply LESS-16 (adapt, don't rewrite)
3. Document changes (LESS-11)

**When refactoring:**
1. Use LESS-16 (preserve API)
2. Verify LESS-14 (incremental improvement)
3. Consider LESS-18 (lifecycle if stateful)

**When adding statefulness:**
1. Apply LESS-18 (singleton pattern)
2. Plan for LESS-14 (future evolution)
3. Document per LESS-11 (why singleton)

## Evolution Principles

**From LESS-14:**
- Design → Implement → Learn → Improve → Repeat
- Each problem drives next improvement
- 95% evolution, 5% rewrite

**From LESS-16:**
- Keep API surface (all exports)
- Modify internals only
- Test backwards compatibility
- Save 66% time

**From LESS-18:**
- Lazy initialization
- Controlled access
- Graceful cleanup
- Memory management
