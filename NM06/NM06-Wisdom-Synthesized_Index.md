## Topic Overview

**Description:** High-level insights synthesized from multiple lessons, bugs, and experiences. These represent patterns and principles that emerged from the collective body of knowledge across the Lambda Execution Engine development. Unlike individual lessons which document specific incidents, wisdom items capture universal principles that apply broadly.

**Keywords:** wisdom, insights, patterns, principles, synthesis, meta-lessons

## Individual Files

### WISD-01: Architecture Prevents Problems
- **File:** `NM06-Wisdom-Synthesized_WISD-01.md`
- **Summary:** Good architecture makes certain mistakes impossible through design rather than relying on developer discipline
- **Priority:** High
- **Synthesizes:** LESS-01, BUG-02, DEC-01

### WISD-02: Measure, Don't Guess
- **File:** `NM06-Wisdom-Synthesized_WISD-02.md`
- **Summary:** Data-driven decisions beat intuition every time; measurement reveals truth
- **Priority:** High
- **Synthesizes:** LESS-02, BUG-01, DEC-05

### WISD-03: Small Costs Early Prevent Large Costs Later
- **File:** `NM06-Wisdom-Synthesized_WISD-03.md`
- **Summary:** Prevention is 10-1000x cheaper than cure; invest in prevention upfront
- **Priority:** High
- **Synthesizes:** LESS-06, BUG-01, DEC-05

### WISD-04: Consistency Over Cleverness
- **File:** `NM06-Wisdom-Synthesized_WISD-04.md`
- **Summary:** Uniform patterns reduce cognitive load; predictable beats clever
- **Priority:** High
- **Synthesizes:** LESS-04, DEC-01, DEC-08

### WISD-05: Document Everything
- **File:** `NM06-Wisdom-Synthesized_WISD-05.md`
- **Summary:** Memory fades, documentation persists; if it's not documented, it doesn't exist
- **Priority:** High
- **Synthesizes:** LESS-11, LESS-12, LESS-13

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Theme 1: Prevention Through Design
**Appears in:**
- WISD-01: Architecture prevents problems
- WISD-03: Small costs early

**Core Insight:** Build prevention into structure, not rules.

### Theme 2: Data-Driven Decisions
**Appears in:**
- WISD-02: Measure don't guess
- WISD-03: Small costs early (ROI calculations)

**Core Insight:** Decisions backed by data beat intuition.

### Theme 3: Human Factors
**Appears in:**
- WISD-04: Consistency over cleverness
- WISD-05: Document everything

**Core Insight:** Design for human understanding and memory limits.

## Applying the Wisdom

**When facing new problem, ask:**

1. **Can architecture prevent?** (WISD-01)
   → Design mistake impossible

2. **What does measurement show?** (WISD-02)
   → Use data, not intuition

3. **What's the ROI of prevention?** (WISD-03)
   → Small cost now vs large cost later?

4. **Does this follow patterns?** (WISD-04)
   → Consistent with rest of system?

5. **Is decision documented?** (WISD-05)
   → Will we remember why in 6 months?

## Summary: The Five Wisdoms

**Together they create:** Robust, maintainable, understandable systems.

1. **Architecture Prevents Problems** - Design away entire bug categories
2. **Measure Don't Guess** - Data beats intuition
3. **Small Costs Early** - Prevention >>> Cure
4. **Consistency Over Cleverness** - Uniform patterns reduce cognitive load
5. **Document Everything** - Memory fades, docs persist
