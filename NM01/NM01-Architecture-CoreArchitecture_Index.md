## Individual Files

### ARCH-01 to ARCH-06: Core SUGA Architecture
- **File:** `NEURAL MAP 01-Core Architecture - IMPLEMENTATION_Core.md` (root /nmap)
- **Summary:** The six foundational architecture patterns - Gateway Trinity, Execution Engine, Router Pattern, Internal Implementation, Extension Architecture, and Lambda Entry Point. Kept grouped because they tell a coherent story.
- **Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Note:** This file remains in root /nmap directory per current structure. Contains ARCH-01, ARCH-02, ARCH-03, ARCH-04, ARCH-05, ARCH-06 as grouped content.

### ARCH-07: LMMS System
- **File:** `NM01-ARCH-07-LMMS-Lambda Memory Management System.md` (root /nmap)
- **Summary:** Lambda Memory Management System - the umbrella architecture for managing complete module lifecycle. Includes LIGS (Lazy Import Gateway System), LUGS (Lazy Unload Gateway System), and ZAPH (Zero-Abstraction Fast Path).
- **Priority:** üü° HIGH
- **Benefits:** 60% faster cold starts, 70% less initial memory, 82% reduction in GB-seconds
- **Note:** Already atomized in v3 format

### ARCH-08: Future/Experimental Architectures
- **File:** `NM01-ARCH-08_Future_Experimental Architectures.md` (root /nmap)
- **Summary:** Three lightly-developed or conceptual architectures: FTPMS (Free Tier Protection & Monitoring), OFB (Operation Fusion & Batching), and MDOE (Metadata-Driven Operation Engine).
- **Priority:** üü¢ MEDIUM
- **Status:** Conceptual / Early Development
- **Note:** Already atomized in v3 format

## Usage Patterns

### Understanding the Architecture
**Query:** "How does the SUGA architecture work?"  
**Answer:** Read ARCH-01 (Gateway Trinity) and ARCH-02 (Execution Engine) for the foundation. These explain the 3-layer pattern and operation routing.

### Performance Optimization
**Query:** "How do I optimize Lambda cold start?"  
**Answer:** Read ARCH-07 (LMMS) for lazy loading, memory management, and fast path caching strategies.

### Adding New Functionality
**Query:** "How do I add a new interface?"  
**Answer:** Read ARCH-05 (Extension Architecture) for the 6-step process to extend the system.

## File Locations

**Note:** Due to current file server structure, some files remain in root /nmap directory:

- **ARCH-01 to ARCH-06:** `/nmap/NEURAL MAP 01-Core Architecture - IMPLEMENTATION_Core.md`
- **ARCH-07:** `/nmap/NM01-ARCH-07-LMMS-Lambda Memory Management System.md`
- **ARCH-08:** `/nmap/NM01-ARCH-08_Future_Experimental Architectures.md`

**Future:** May reorganize to `/nmap/NM01/` subdirectory for consistency.
