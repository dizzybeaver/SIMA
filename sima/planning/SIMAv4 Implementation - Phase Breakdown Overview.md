### For Implementers:

1. **Start with Phase 0** (file server config - NEW)
2. **Complete phases sequentially** (0 → 1 → 2 → ... → 9)
3. **Don't skip phases** - each builds on previous
4. **Use phase-specific tools** and templates
5. **Validate before proceeding** to next phase

### For Project Managers:

1. **Use this overview** for high-level tracking
2. **Monitor phase completion** via weekly reports

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES

### Phase Dependencies

**Sequential Phases (MUST complete in order):**
- Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4

**Parallel Possible After Phase 4:**
- Phase 5 (Validation) can run parallel with Phase 6 (Documentation)
- Phase 7 (Rollout) requires Phase 5 + 6 complete
- Phase 8 (Monitoring) can start during Phase 7
- Phase 9 (Advanced) can run independently

### Phase 0 is NEW

**Phase 0 (File Server Config) was added after original planning:**
- Not in original SIMAv4 document
- Identified as critical during review
- Must complete BEFORE Phase 1
- Foundation for all subsequent phases

### Don't Skip Validation

**Phase 5 is critical:**
- Validates all previous work
- Catches errors early
- Prevents propagation of mistakes
- Required before rollout
