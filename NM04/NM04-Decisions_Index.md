## Category Overview

**Purpose:** Document all design decisions made during Lambda Execution Engine development. Each decision includes full rationale, alternatives considered, trade-offs accepted, and impact assessment. This category preserves the "why" behind every significant choice.

**Scope:** Architectural patterns, technical implementations, operational strategies, and all choices that shaped how the system was built. Decisions are living documents - they can be revisited when context changes.

## Decision Making Process

**How Decisions Are Made:**
1. **Identify Problem:** What needs deciding?
2. **Research Alternatives:** What are the options?
3. **Analyze Trade-offs:** What are costs and benefits?
4. **Make Decision:** Choose with rationale
5. **Document in NM04:** Capture why, alternatives, trade-offs
6. **Implement:** Build it
7. **Validate:** Measure impact
8. **Update if Needed:** Add to version history

**Decision Template Includes:**
- **Summary:** What was decided (1-2 sentences)
- **Context:** Why decision needed (problem statement)
- **Rationale:** Why this choice (3-5 reasons with evidence)
- **Alternatives:** What else considered (2-3 with pros/cons)
- **Trade-offs:** What accepted, what gained
- **Impact:** On architecture, development, performance, maintenance
- **Future:** When to revisit, potential evolution
- **Related:** Cross-references (5-7 REF-IDs)
- **Keywords:** Search terms (6-8)
