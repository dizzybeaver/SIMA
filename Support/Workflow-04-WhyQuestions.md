## 💡 COMMON "WHY" QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q1: Why use SIMA pattern?

**Quick Answer:**
SIMA pattern (Single entry point through Gateway) prevents circular imports and provides clean separation of concerns.

**Full Answer:**
According to **DEC-01**, we chose SIMA because:
1. Prevents circular import hell (experienced in early development)
2. Single entry point simplifies debugging
3. Clear dependency flow (Gateway → Interface → Core)
4. Easy to mock for testing
5. Scalable as system grows

**References:** DEC-01, ARCH-01, RULE-01

---

### Q2: Why no threading locks?

**Quick Answer:**
Lambda is single-threaded, making threading locks unnecessary and harmful.

**Full Answer:**
According to **DEC-04**, Lambda executes code in a single-threaded environment:
1. One request processed at a time
2. No concurrent access to shared state
3. Threading primitives add overhead without benefit
4. Locks can't prevent race conditions across invocations
5. Better to use atomic operations or external coordination

Related to **AP-08** (Threading primitives anti-pattern)

**References:** DEC-04, AP-08, LESS-06

---

### Q3: Why lazy imports?

**Quick Answer:**
Defer imports to reduce cold start time below 3 seconds.

**Full Answer:**
According to **ARCH-07** (LMMS), lazy imports are critical for cold start optimization:
1. Cold start budget: < 3 seconds total
2. Import overhead: ~50-200ms per heavy module
3. Lazy imports: Only pay cost when needed
4. Hot path optimization: Preload only critical modules
5. Memory efficiency: Don't load unused code

**References:** ARCH-07, PATH-01, LESS-02

---

### Q4: Why sanitize sentinels at router?

**Quick Answer:**
Sentinel objects can't be JSON serialized and cause Lambda to crash.

**Full Answer:**
According to **BUG-01** and **DEC-05**:

**The Problem:**
- Sentinels (_CacheMiss, _NotFound) used internally
- If leaked to Lambda response → JSON serialization fails
- Lambda returns 500 error

**The Solution:**
- Sanitize at router layer (lambda_function.py)
- Convert sentinels to None or appropriate defaults
- Never let sentinels cross Lambda boundary

**Cost:**
- One sentinel leak caused 535ms penalty per request
- Required emergency hotfix

**References:** BUG-01, DEC-05, AP-19

---

### Q5: Why SSM Parameter Store token-only?

**Quick Answer:**
Simplified from full-config to token-only after production experience.

**Full Answer:**
According to **DEC-21**:

**Evolution:**
1. **Phase 1:** All config in SSM (over-engineered)
2. **Phase 2:** Hybrid SSM + environment variables (confusing)
3. **Phase 3:** Token-only in SSM (optimal)

**Rationale:**
- Only sensitive data needs encryption (tokens)
- Everything else in environment variables (faster)
- Simpler configuration management
- Lower SSM API calls (cost optimization)

**References:** DEC-21, LESS-19

---

### Q6: Why flat file structure?

**Quick Answer:**
Subdirectories complicate imports and debugging without adding value.

**Full Answer:**
According to **DEC-08**:

**Tried:** Subdirectories for organization
**Problems:**
- Import paths longer and complex
- Debugging harder (find file in hierarchy)
- No clear benefit for ~90 files
- More directories ≠ better organization

**Solution:**
- Flat structure except `home_assistant/` extension
- Descriptive filenames replace directory hierarchy
- Easier to navigate, grep, and maintain

**Exception:** Extensions get subdirectories (ha_*)

**References:** DEC-08, AP-05

---

### Q7: Why 128MB memory limit?

**Quick Answer:**
AWS Lambda free tier constraint, forces efficiency.

**Full Answer:**
According to **DEC-07**:

**Constraint:** AWS free tier = 128MB max
**Philosophy:** Constraints drive good design
**Benefits:**
1. Forces careful dependency selection
2. Prevents dependency bloat
3. Encourages lazy loading
4. Fast cold starts (less to load)
5. Lower costs (memory = money)

**Result:**
- SUGA-ISP runs efficiently in 128MB
- Proves serverless viability
- Transferable to other projects

**References:** DEC-07, ARCH-07
