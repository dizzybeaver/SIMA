3. Note LESS-23 (question patterns)

**During Development:**
1. Apply LESS-19 (input validation)
2. Configure LESS-24 (rate limiting)
3. Monitor with LESS-10 (performance)

**Before Committing:**
1. Run LESS-15 verification
2. Increment LESS-53 version
3. Check LESS-27-39 health

### For Reviewers

**Code Review Checklist:**
1. LESS-15 verification completed?
2. LESS-36 extra scrutiny if infrastructure?
3. LESS-23 verify "intentional" decisions?
4. LESS-19 input validation present?
5. LESS-53 version incremented?

### For Deployers

**Pre-Deployment:**
1. LESS-09 atomic packaging
