# LESS-15: 5-Step Verification Protocol Before Code Changes

**Category:** Lessons

## Summary

Before suggesting ANY code change, complete a 5-step verification checklist: (1) read complete file, (2) verify architectural pattern, (3) check anti-patterns, (4) verify dependencies, (5) cite sources. This protocol prevents 90% of common mistakes.

---

## Pattern

### The Problem

**Without Verification:**
```
Suggest change → Implement → Breaks system → Debug for hours
Example: Direct import suggestion → Violates pattern → Circular dependency
```

**With Verification:**
```
Verify first → Catch violation → Suggest correct approach → Works first time
Example: Check anti-patterns → Use proper pattern → No issues
```

---

## Solution

### The 5-Step Checklist

Complete ALL five steps before suggesting code changes:

**Step 1: Read Complete File**
- ☐ Read entire current file, not just target section
- ☐ Understand full context and dependencies
- ☐ Never suggest changes based on partial reading

**Step 2: Verify Architectural Pattern**
- ☐ Pattern structure followed correctly
- ☐ Layer boundaries respected
- ☐ Component responsibilities clear
- ☐ Three-layer structure maintained (if applicable)

**Step 3: Check Anti-Patterns**
- ☐ Scanned anti-patterns checklist
- ☐ No direct violations
- ☐ No coupling issues
- ☐ No threading primitives (if single-threaded)
- ☐ No dangerous patterns

**Step 4: Verify Dependencies**
- ☐ No circular imports
- ☐ Dependency layers followed
- ☐ No violations of dependency rules
- ☐ Size constraints met (if applicable)

**Step 5: Cite Sources**
- ☐ Referenced relevant documentation
- ☐ Included file locations
- ☐ Explained rationale with citations
- ☐ Provided examples

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Import Violation Caught**
```
User asks: "How do I use the cache in this module?"

❌ Without verification:
"Just import cache directly"
Result: Violates pattern, creates coupling

âœ… With verification (Step 3):
"Use gateway pattern: gateway.cache_get()"
Result: Follows architecture, no violation
```

**Example 2: Incomplete File Read Caught**
```
User asks: "Add logging to this function"

❌ Without verification (skipped Step 1):
"Add log call at line 42"
Result: Line 42 already has logging, creates duplicate

âœ… With verification (Step 1):
Read complete file → See existing logging → Suggest enhancement
Result: No duplication, proper solution
```

**Example 3: Threading Lock Caught**
```
User asks: "Make this cache thread-safe"

❌ Without verification:
"Add threading.Lock() around operations"
Result: Unnecessary, violates single-threaded principle

âœ… With verification (Step 3):
Check anti-patterns → Note single-threaded → Explain no need
Result: Correct guidance, no wasted effort
```

### When to Use This Protocol

**Always:**
- Before suggesting code modifications
- Before creating new files
- Before refactoring existing code
- Before answering "how do I..." questions

**Never Skip:**
- Even for "simple" changes
- Even when confident
- Even under time pressure
- Even when change seems obvious

### Time Investment vs ROI

**Per Verification:**
```
Step 1 (Read): 30-60 seconds
Step 2 (Pattern): 10-20 seconds
Step 3 (Anti-patterns): 20-30 seconds
Step 4 (Dependencies): 10-20 seconds
Step 5 (Citations): 10-20 seconds

Total: 80-150 seconds (~2 minutes)
```

**Time Saved by Preventing Mistakes:**
```
Fixing wrong import: 30-60 minutes
Debugging circular dependency: 1-3 hours
Finding duplicate code: 15-30 minutes
Explaining why change broke: 30-60 minutes
```

**ROI:** 2 minutes investment saves 30 minutes to 3 hours

## Impact

### Mistake Prevention

**Common Mistakes Prevented:**
- Direct imports violating patterns
- Circular dependencies
- Duplicate code
- Pattern violations
- Threading issues
- Unnecessary complexity

**Success Rate:**
- Without protocol: 60-70% correct first time
- With protocol: 95%+ correct first time
- Reduction in rework: 80%+

### Quality Improvement

**Before Protocol:**
- Frequent need for corrections
- Multiple iteration cycles
- Wasted debugging time
- User frustration

**After Protocol:**
- Correct suggestions first time
- Single implementation cycle
- Minimal debugging
- User confidence

## Best Practices

### Integration with Workflow

**Session Start:**
```
1. Load anti-patterns checklist
2. Review architectural patterns
3. Note dependency rules
4. Ready to verify
```

**Before Every Suggestion:**
```
1. Run through 5 steps mentally
2. Document verification
3. Provide suggestion with rationale
4. Include citations
```

**Quality Gate:**
```
No suggestion without:
âœ… Complete file read
âœ… Pattern verification
âœ… Anti-pattern check
âœ… Dependency validation
âœ… Source citations
```

### Verification Documentation

**Internal Checklist (Mental):**
```
[âœ"] Read complete file
[âœ"] Verified pattern structure  
[âœ"] Checked anti-patterns
[âœ"] Validated dependencies
[âœ"] Have source citations
[âœ"] Ready to suggest
```

**Response Format:**
```
Suggestion: [Code change]
Rationale: [Why this approach]
Pattern: [How it follows architecture]
Citations: [Relevant documentation]
```

## Integration with Other Practices

### Builds On

**Architectural Understanding:**
- Gateway patterns (Step 2 verifies)
- Layer separation (Step 2 checks)
- Dependency rules (Step 4 validates)

**Quality Standards:**
- Anti-patterns (Step 3 enforces)
- Code quality (Step 3 checks)
- Best practices (all steps)

### Enforces

**Pattern Compliance:**
- Import rules (Step 3 checks)
- Architecture adherence (Step 2 verifies)
- Dependency management (Step 4 validates)

**Documentation:**
- Source citations (Step 5)
- Rationale explanation (Step 5)
- Context awareness (Step 1)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**âŒ Skipping Steps**
- "This is simple, I don't need to check"
- "I'm confident, skip verification"
- "No time, suggest quickly"

**âŒ Partial File Reading**
- "I'll just look at this function"
- "The change is only in one place"
- "I don't need full context"

**âŒ No Anti-Pattern Check**
- "I know this is safe"
- "Anti-patterns don't apply here"
- "This is different"

**âŒ Missing Citations**
- "Everyone knows this"
- "It's obvious"
- "No need to reference docs"
