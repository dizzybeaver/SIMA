## Summary

Always assess component current state before estimating effort - starting points can vary by 85%, dramatically affecting work required. A 5-minute assessment can reveal 60-90% time savings.

---

## Context

**Universal Pattern:**
Components have vastly different optimization starting points, requiring different effort levels despite same end goal.

**Why This Matters:**
Never assume uniform starting points across similar components. Assessment prevents wasted effort and enables accurate planning.

### Starting Point Variance Example

| Component | Starting State | Completion | Effort Needed |
|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Component A** | 30% | 100% | Very High (full work) |
| **Component B** | 70% | 90% | Low (additions only) |
| **Component C** | 85% | 95% | Very Low (minor additions) |

### Assessment Protocol (5 minutes)

```python
# Quick check for each component:
âœ“ Threading locks present?
âœ“ Pattern registration?
âœ“ Rate limiting?
âœ“ Memory limits?
âœ“ Security validations?
âœ“ Reset operation?
âœ“ Operations implemented?

Score: Count âœ“ marks
0-2: Need everything (100% effort)
3-4: Need most (60-80% effort)
5-6: Need some (20-40% effort)
7: Need minimal (5-15% effort)
```

### Estimation Adjustment

| Score | Effort Multiplier | Example |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| 0-2 (Low) | 1.0Ã— | 2 hours baseline |
| 3-4 (Medium) | 0.6-0.8Ã— | 1.2-1.6 hours |
| 5-6 (High) | 0.2-0.4Ã— | 0.4-0.8 hours |
| 7 (Very High) | 0.05-0.15Ã— | 0.1-0.3 hours |

### Real Example

```
Initial Plan (no assessment):
- Component B: 2 hours
- Component C: 2 hours
- Total: 4 hours

After Assessment:
- Component B: 70% done â†’ 0.6 hours
- Component C: 85% done â†’ 0.4 hours
- Total: 1 hour (75% time savings!)

Actual:
- Component B: 1 hour
- Component C: 0.5 hours
- Total: 1.5 hours (62% time savings)
```

### Key Insight

**Never assume uniform starting points across similar components. A 5-minute assessment can reveal 60-90% time savings.**
