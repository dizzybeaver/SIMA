## Purpose

This file **synthesizes high-level patterns** from all bugs and lessons documented in NM06. Rather than documenting individual incidents, this captures the meta-lessons and cross-cutting themes.

**Wisdom vs Lessons:**
- Lessons: Specific incidents and discoveries
- Wisdom: Patterns that emerge from multiple lessons
- Lessons: "What happened and why"
- Wisdom: "Universal principles that apply broadly"

## Wisdom 1: Architecture Prevents Problems

**REF:** NM06-WISD-01  
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM  
**TAGS:** architecture, prevention, design-patterns, meta-lesson  
**KEYWORDS:** architecture prevents, design prevents problems, prevention by design  
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-01, NM06-BUG-02, NM04-DEC-01

### The Pattern

**Good architecture makes certain mistakes impossible:**

```
Traditional approach:
Write rules → Hope developers follow rules → Bugs when rules broken

SIMA approach:
Design architecture → Rules enforced by structure → Mistakes prevented
```

### Evidence from Multiple Lessons

**1. Circular Imports (NM06-BUG-02)**
```
Problem: Modules can import each other → circular dependencies
SIMA Solution: Gateway pattern → circular imports impossible
Result: Bug prevented architecturally, not by discipline
```

**2. Sentinel Leak (NM06-BUG-01)**
```
Problem: Internal objects can leak to user code
SIMA Solution: Router sanitization layer → leaks prevented
Result: Sanitization automatic, not optional
```

**3. Cascading Failures (NM06-BUG-03)**
```
Problem: One interface failure can crash system
SIMA Solution: Error boundaries at layers → isolation guaranteed
Result: Failures contained architecturally
```

### Universal Principle

**"Don't rely on discipline, rely on architecture"**

```
Weak: "Developers should not create circular imports"
Strong: "Architecture prevents circular imports"

Weak: "Developers should sanitize internal objects"
Strong: "Router layer enforces sanitization"

Weak: "Developers should handle errors"
Strong: "Gateway layer provides error boundaries"
```

### When to Apply

**Ask: "Can architecture prevent this problem?"**

```
If YES:
✅ Change architecture to prevent
✅ Make mistake impossible
✅ Enforce rule structurally

If NO:
✅ Document the rule
✅ Review in code reviews
✅ Test for violation
```

## Wisdom 2: Measure, Don't Guess

**REF:** NM06-WISD-02  
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM  
**TAGS:** measurement, data-driven, performance, debugging  
**KEYWORDS:** measure don't guess, data-driven decisions, empirical evidence  
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-02, NM06-LESS-10, NM06-BUG-01

### The Pattern

**Data beats intuition in every case:**

```
Guessing approach:
Problem → Intuition → Solution attempt → Hope it works

Measurement approach:
Problem → Measure → Identify cause → Targeted solution → Verify
```

### Evidence from Multiple Lessons

**1. Sentinel Bug Discovery (NM06-BUG-01)**
```
Intuition: "Imports must be slow"
Measurement: "Cache operations taking 535ms"
Result: Found actual problem in 15 minutes
```

**2. Configuration Complexity (NM06-BUG-04)**
```
Intuition: "More parameters = more flexible"
Measurement: "15% deployment failure rate"
Result: Simplified to token-only, 0% failures
```

**3. Cold Start Optimization (NM06-LESS-10)**
```
Without data: Tried random optimizations
With data: Identified exact 535ms penalty
Result: Targeted fix, immediate improvement
```

### Universal Principle

**"If you're not measuring, you're guessing"**

```
Weak: "This seems slow, let me optimize"
Strong: "This takes 535ms, expected 5ms, gap of 530ms"

Weak: "Users complain it's slow"
Strong: "P95 latency is 850ms, target is 200ms"

Weak: "I think this will help"
Strong: "Baseline 320ms, after change 285ms, 35ms improvement"
```

### What to Measure

**Essential metrics:**
```
Performance:
- Cold start time (should be < 500ms)
- Request latency (should be < 200ms)
- Operation timing (breakdown of where time goes)

Reliability:
- Error rate (should be < 1%)
- Success rate by operation
- Failure modes

Resources:
- Memory usage (must stay under 128MB)
- Token consumption (optimize expensive operations)
```

### When to Apply

**Always measure before optimizing:**

```
Before: Establish baseline
During: Measure improvement attempts
After: Verify improvement achieved
```

**Red flags that measurement needed:**
- "I think X is the problem" (opinion, not data)
- "This seems slow" (subjective, not measured)
- "Let me try Y" (guessing, not targeted)

## Wisdom 3: Small Costs Early Prevent Large Costs Later

**REF:** NM06-WISD-03  
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM  
**TAGS:** prevention, cost-benefit, technical-debt, early-investment  
**KEYWORDS:** pay costs early, prevention cheaper, technical debt, ROI  
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-06, NM06-LESS-15, NM06-BUG-01

### The Pattern

**Prevention cheaper than cure:**

```
Pay small costs early:
- 2 minutes verification → prevents 90 minute outage
- 0.5ms sanitization → prevents 535ms bug
- 1 hour documentation → saves 100 hours of re-discovery
```

### Evidence from Multiple Lessons

**1. Sentinel Sanitization (NM06-LESS-06)**
```
Prevention cost: 0.5ms per operation
Bug cost: 535ms cold start penalty
Ratio: 1:1000 (prevention 1000x cheaper)
```

**2. File Verification (NM06-LESS-15)**
```
Prevention cost: 2 minutes before deployment
Bug cost: 90 minutes production outage
Ratio: 1:45 (prevention 45x cheaper)
```

**3. Documentation (NM06-LESS-11)**
```
Prevention cost: 1 hour writing decision doc
Bug cost: 100+ hours re-discovering reasoning
Ratio: 1:100+ (prevention 100x cheaper)
```

### Universal Principle

**"The cheapest bug fix is the one prevented"**

```
Cost hierarchy (cheapest to most expensive):
1. Prevention by architecture (0 cost - impossible to create)
2. Prevention by automation (small one-time cost)
3. Caught in development (medium cost - fix quickly)
4. Caught in testing (high cost - rollback needed)
5. Caught in production (very high cost - outage)
6. Never caught (astronomical cost - ongoing issues)
```

### ROI Examples

**High ROI investments:**
```
Verification scripts: 1 day → saves 20 outages/year
Monitoring setup: 2 hours → finds bugs in minutes not days
Documentation system: 1 week → saves 100+ hours/year
Architecture patterns: 1 month → prevents entire bug categories
```

**When to invest:**

```
✅ Small cost, large benefit
   Example: 2 min verification prevents 90 min outage

✅ One-time cost, recurring benefit
   Example: Setup monitoring once, use forever

✅ Scales well
   Example: Document decision once, reference forever

❌ Large cost, small benefit
   Example: Complex system for rare problem
```

## Wisdom 4: Consistency Over Cleverness

**REF:** NM06-WISD-04  
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM  
**TAGS:** consistency, simplicity, maintainability, patterns  
**KEYWORDS:** consistency over clever, uniform patterns, maintainability  
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-04, NM06-LESS-13, NM04-DEC-03

### The Pattern

**Uniform patterns reduce cognitive load:**

```
Inconsistent codebase:
- 5 different patterns for similar problems
- Must remember which pattern where
- Hard to onboard new developers
- Easy to make mistakes

Consistent codebase:
- 1 pattern for similar problems
- Learn once, apply everywhere
- Easy to onboard (understand pattern, understand system)
- Hard to make mistakes (pattern is obvious)
```

### Evidence from Multiple Lessons

**1. Interface Dispatch (NM06-LESS-04)**
```
Before: Each interface used different routing pattern
After: All interfaces use dispatch dictionaries
Result: Any developer can add operation to any interface
```

**2. Teachability (NM06-LESS-13)**
```
Before: "This interface is special because..."
After: "All interfaces work the same way"
Result: 3-day onboarding instead of 2-week
```

**3. SIMA Itself (This System)**
```
Before: Monolithic files, inconsistent structure
After: Gateway → Interface → Implementation (always)
Result: Natural navigation, predictable structure
```

### Universal Principle

**"One obvious way to do it"**

```
Multiple patterns:
- Developer: "Which pattern should I use?"
- Code review: "Why different from other interfaces?"
- New hire: "How does this one work?"

Single pattern:
- Developer: "I'll use the standard pattern"
- Code review: "Follows standard pattern ✅"
- New hire: "Works like all the others"
```

### When Consistency Matters Most

**High-leverage consistency:**
```
✅ Interfaces (all should route the same way)
✅ Error handling (all should handle errors uniformly)
✅ Testing (all should test the same aspects)
✅ Documentation (all should document same topics)
✅ Deployment (all should deploy same way)
```

**Low-leverage consistency:**
```
❌ Variable naming (minor cognitive load)
❌ File organization within functions (internal detail)
❌ Comment style (doesn't affect understanding)
```

### Breaking Consistency

**When to break:**
```
Rarely. Only when:
1. Strong technical reason (not just preference)
2. Document heavily why different
3. Isolate the special case
4. Consider if can adapt pattern instead
```

## Wisdom 5: Document Everything (Especially Decisions)

**REF:** NM06-WISD-05  
**PRIORITY:** 🟢 MEDIUM  
**TAGS:** documentation, knowledge-preservation, institutional-memory  
**KEYWORDS:** document decisions, preserve knowledge, institutional memory  
**RELATED:** NM06-LESS-11, NM06-LESS-12, NM06-LESS-13

### The Pattern

**Memory fades, documentation persists:**

```
Undocumented system:
- 6 months later: "Why did we do this?"
- 1 year later: "What problem does this solve?"
- 2 years later: "Can we remove this?"

Documented system:
- 6 months later: "See NM04-DEC-01 for rationale"
- 1 year later: "Solves NM06-BUG-02 (circular imports)"
- 2 years later: "Still needed, prevents entire bug category"
```

### Evidence from Multiple Lessons

**1. Design Decisions (NM06-LESS-11)**
```
Problem: Can't remember why decisions made
Solution: SIMA documents all decisions with rationale
Result: No re-litigation of decided issues
```

**2. Bug Post-Mortems (All of NM06-BUGS)**
```
Problem: Fixed bugs, forgot how/why
Solution: Document symptom, cause, solution, prevention
Result: Don't repeat mistakes, apply lessons broadly
```

**3. SIMA System Itself**
```
Problem: Lost institutional knowledge
Solution: Neural map architecture
Result: Persistent, searchable, cross-referenced knowledge
```

### Universal Principle

**"If it's not documented, it doesn't exist"**

```
Code says WHAT:
def execute_operation(interface, operation, **kwargs):
    return router(operation, **kwargs)

Documentation says WHY:
"""
Gateway pattern routes all operations through central hub.
Prevents circular imports (NM06-BUG-02).
Enables consistent testing (NM06-LESS-04).
See NM04-DEC-01 for full rationale.
"""
```

### What to Document

**Critical documentation:**
```
1. Design decisions
   - What we chose
   - Why we chose it
   - What alternatives considered
   - Trade-offs accepted

2. Bugs and fixes
   - What went wrong
   - Root cause
   - How fixed
   - How to prevent

3. Lessons learned
   - What we discovered
   - Impact on architecture
   - Changes made
   - Future considerations

4. Architecture patterns
   - How system works
   - Why designed this way
   - How to extend
   - Common pitfalls
```

### Documentation Hierarchy
